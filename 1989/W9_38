 Preliminary tests in Parkinson's disease patients suggest that a new medicine born of research on illicit street drugs may slow the progress of the degenerative brain disorder.  Two California researchers reported that the medicine, called deprenyl, postponed the onset of severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease in a small group of patients with very early signs of the disorder.  In the study, 27 patients given deprenyl went for an average 18 months before developing the severe symptoms, while another 27 patients given a placebo, or inactive drug, developed the symptoms after about 10 months.  The drug also slowed the rate of progress of the disease, as measured by several tests, by 40% to 80%, compared with those who took the placebo.  "It is a very encouraging result," said Ira Shoulson, a neurologist at the University of Rochester, N.Y. Dr. Shoulson helped set up a separate $10 million, federally sponsored test of deprenyl in 800 Parkinson's patients.  That study, being conducted in 26 medical centers, will be completed by late 1990.  Parkinson's affects about a half million Americans, mostly over age 50, causing paralysis and uncontrollable tremors.  L-dopa, the drug most commonly used against the disease, has side effects and loses its effectiveness over time.  The authors of the new study said deprenyl might replace L-dopa or delay the need to use L-dopa.  Publication of the California study today in the journal Science is expected to stir interest in several companies.  Somerset Pharmaceuticals Inc., in Denville, N.J., owns the U.S. rights to the drug under the brand name Selegiline.  Somerset is owned in a 50-50 venture by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., Copiague, N.Y., and Mylan Laboratories Inc., Pittsburgh, two small publicly-traded generic drug makers.  The companies acquired Somerset for $33.5 million last year, because of growing interest in deprenyl.  Somerset began selling deprenyl in June after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug for use in treating advanced stages of Parkinson's disease in combination with L-dopa.  Prior studies had shown that deprenyl prolongs the effectiveness of L-dopa in relieving the disease's symptoms.  L-dopa is sold under the brand name Sinemet by Merck & Co. Deprenyl Research Ltd., a publicly-traded Toronto company, sells the drug, its only product, in Canada.  The new study's authors, James W. Tetrud and J. William Langston, of the Institute for Medical Research in San Jose, Calif., began their research after treating young drug abusers who developed severe Parkinson's-like symptoms.  The symptoms, the researchers found, were caused by synthetic, heroin-like street drugs contaminated in their production with a chemical, called MPTP.  The researchers found that MPTP caused the distinctive symptoms by killing the same brain cells destroyed by Parkinson's.  Further studies by the researchers found that MPTP was actually converted by a brain enzyme into another chemical, which carried out the cell destruction.  By searching through the literature of medical research, the Californians found that the brain enzyme could be blocked by deprenyl, which had been developed in Hungary as an anti-depressant.  After studies showed that deprenyl could block Parkinson's-like symptoms in test animals administered MPTP, several research teams rushed to show the drug would be similarly effective in blocking the enzyme in humans.  In an interview, Dr. Langston said his results need to be confirmed; he said he hoped the large federal study organized by Dr. Shoulson will do that.  But, he said, his findings provide the first evidence that the progression of a degenerative nerve disease can be slowed.  Several researchers are now testing deprenyl against Alzheimer's disease and amytrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  Both are degenerative brain disorders similar to Parkinson's.  Dr. Langston said research into MPTP also is seeking clues to the cause of Parkinson's.  He and his colleague have speculated that some toxic chemical in the environment kicks off the disease, mimicking MPTP in the brain.  He and others are attempting to identify the environmental substance.  Fishery and environmental groups have launched an intense lobbying effort to delay until further study the use of an untried Exxon Corp. dispersant to hasten cleanup of oil-encrusted beaches in Alaska's Prince William Sound.  Supported by the Coast Guard and a reticent Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Exxon has received tentative approval to use the chemical in an "expanded test" that could result in its application on two large islands in the western sound this weekend.  Should those tests prove successful -- and the chemical judged to be relatively harmless to the environment -- Exxon would likely get the green light to use the kerosene-based agent to tackle stubborn tarlike oil still clinging to hundreds of miles of Prince William Sound beaches following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March.  Foes, noting that large-scale use of dispersants in near-shore environments is unprecedented, charged that more needs to be known about potential hazardous effects of the Exxon chemical before it is spread on the sound's beaches.  "We are mobilizing to block the use of this stuff until we know more about it," said Jerry McCune, a spokesman for Cordova District Fishermen United, a Prince William Sound fisheries group.  The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund accused federal and state officials of using "haste and secrecy" to rush the product to approval and called its use without further testing "truly alarming."  "This may indeed be great stuff and perfectly harmless but no one really knows that for sure," added Stewart Elgie, a Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund spokesman in Juneau.  Known as Corexit 9580, the chemical essentially is a kerosene solvent stripped of its most toxic compounds and mixed with a surfactant to aid in washing oil off rocks, Exxon says.  Dogged by deeply embedded oil resistant to more traditional water cleanup methods, Exxon has been pushing for expedited use of the dispersant after initial small-scale tests indicated it greatly speeds the removal of heavily weathered, tarlike oil from the sound's rocky beaches.  An Exxon spokewoman said that besides being nontoxic, Corexit 9580 has "low dispersant" properties -- meaning that it doesn't break oil down into such small droplets that it can't be recovered from the water by traditional skimming methods.  "We are anxious to get started with this," she added.  The chemical also has an advocate in Vice Adm. Clyde E. Robbins, the Coast Guard's on-scene spill coordinator, who says federal studies of Corexit 9580, while not conclusive, indicate it can greatly speed up the cleanup with minimal harmful effects.  "Our problem is that we have oil in great amounts and a short amount of time to get rid of it," Vice Adm. Robbins said.  "We have real concerns and we know that this is a bit of a gamble," added Joe Ferguson, a spokesman for Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation.  Mr. Ferguson said the state has reluctantly signed off on the interim use of the dispersant because it may indeed help speed the cleanup.  "Nonetheless, our ultimate decision on whether to go beyond these tests will depend on what we see from the field, and our monitoring of toxicity data," Mr. Ferguson added.  The Coast Guard and state conceded that Exxon's own studies of the chemical's effectiveness, while they showed promise, were far from conclusive.  And Exxon has yet to deliver the results of toxicity tests it recently conducted to determine the impact of the dispersant on salmon and other animals and organisms in the sound.  "Our concern, lacking these results, is that use of the dispersant is simply going to shift the oil to a less-visible, more-harmful location," said Mr. Elgie of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.  The two target islands are Green and Smith, both of which were heavily oiled following the March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez, which spilled 260,000 barrels of oil.  Beaches of both islands serve as traditional haul-out areas for seals during a late summer molting season.  The islands also lie in a zone in the sound that -- based upon the federal government's oil-spill response plan for Prince William Sound -- have been put off-limits to use of dispersants.  Conventional scientific wisdom is that any short-term toxic effects of dispersants are greatly magnified if they are used in shallow, environmentally sensitive areas near shore.  Federal regulators placed Lincoln Savings & Loan Association into receivership, wresting ownership of the insolvent thrift from American Continental Corp., which is in bankruptcy-law proceedings.  Regulators put the Irvine, Calif., thrift into conservatorship in April, and have been overseeing its day-to-day operations since then.  But in conservatorship, the thrift was still owned by American Continental, Phoenix, Ariz., which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code protection from creditors the day before Lincoln was seized.  American Continental has sued the regulators for their takeover of Lincoln.  "The holding company no longer has the Lincoln asset," Allan Bortel, a San Francisco-based thrift analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said of the regulators' most recent action.  "The holding company has a big hole in it without Lincoln there."  "We aren't surprised," A. Melvin McDonald, a lawyer for American Continental in Phoenix, said of the regulators' action.  "The leaks by the regulators {to the press} had indicated this was their conspiracy all along."  Mr. McDonald said: "When they took over Lincoln in April, it was solvent.  Only one of two things could have happened: they either dummied or doctored the books to drive the value down . . . or they have demonstrated the irresponsibility of their management."  He said American Continental is considering "all of the options available" to fight the regulators in court.  The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the receivership action, which created a new federal mutual association to assume all of Lincoln's deposits and assets and most of its liabilities, "further preserves assets of Lincoln, minimizes the eventual cost of resolving the association to the federal insurer and to taxpayers and further protects depositors."  It added that the action doesn't affect depositors' ability to conduct "business as usual."  Analysts have estimated that a bailout of the thrift could cost the government $2 billion or more.  The Bank Board said a recent examination of the thrift's condition determined it is insolvent, with a negative net worth of $631 million as of June 30.  A Bank Board spokesman said Lincoln had a second-quarter loss of $783 million, of which $325 million was an operating loss.  The rest of the loss came primarily from reserves for loan losses and write-downs of assets.  Regulators also revised and increased Lincoln's loss for the first quarter, to $59 million.  California thrift regulators, who do their own calculations of Lincoln's earnings, last week said the thrift had an $847 million first-half loss, sending its net worth plunging to a negative $906 million.  American Continental had long been criticized for using Lincoln's federally insured deposits for such non-traditional investments as real estate and junk bonds.  The Bank Board said that "the institution's assets had been substantially dissipated through violations of laws, rules and regulations and unsafe and unsound practices."  To reduce foreign trade surpluses, and hence the U.S. trade deficit, a number of U.S. trading partners have been asked to curb their competitiveness by letting their currencies appreciate against the dollar.  Some question the effectiveness of this strategy.  John Chipman of the University of Minnesota argued on this page in June that a country's trade balance depends on underlying macroeconomic conditions and that changes in exchange rates play no role.  But the two are closely tied and jointly influence the trade balance.  For example, an increase in investment demand or in government spending can lead to larger trade deficits by raising current income and the demand for imports.  If accompanied by a rise in interest rates, increases in demand will also be associated with currency appreciation and reduced competitiveness, producing an increase in the trade deficit beyond that associated with higher domestic income.  While the theoretical issues (including the desirability of minimizing trade imbalances) cannot be fully dealt with here, the experience of Taiwan and South Korea can help clarify the relationship between exchange rates and trade.  Both Taiwan and Korea have had large trade surpluses and have sought to reduce them by letting their currencies appreciate against the dollar.  The charts trace the paths of competitiveness, as represented by the trade-weighted exchange rate, and the trade balances in Taiwan and Korea over the past 10 years up to the third quarter of 1988 (see accompanying chart-- WSJ Aug. 4, 1989).  In the charts, real exchange-rate depreciation, or a gain in competitiveness, is represented by an upward movement in the shaded lines.  (The real exchange rate is a weighted average of the value of the New Taiwan dollar and the Korean won, respectively, against the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, and the German mark-with adjustments for the consumer price levels in these economies.  The weights reflect the 1980 bileratal trade of Taiwan and Korea with industrial countries.  The real trade balance illustrates changes in merchandise trade volumes in Taiwan and Korea, expressed in constant dollars.  Both the exchange-rate and trade-balance series have been smoothed by taking three-quarter moving averages in order to emphasize the underlying trends.)  The charts show the trade-weighted exchange rates of Taiwan and Korea have steadily appreciated since late 1986, meaning a decline in competitiveness.  This corresponds with a significant reduction in their trade surpluses. (Recent reports indicate the increase in Korea's trade surplus in the second half of 1988 was reversed in the first half of 1989.) Conversely, earlier exchange-rate depreciation was broadly associated with increases in the trade surplus in both economies.  The relationship between exchange rates and trade in these two economies is confirmed by statistical analysis. (See my article in the spring 1989 San Francisco Fed Economic Review.)  However, changes in exchange rates and the trade balance do not always move together.  For example, Taiwan's trade surplus increased sharply in the early 1980s, notwithstanding a marked currency appreciation.  At the time, a slump in investment demand caused growth and the relative demand for imports to fall sharply, offsetting the tendency for the exchange-rate appreciation to reduce the trade balance.  In contrast, after 1985, accelerating economic growth and a pickup in investment spending in Taiwan has reinforced the impact of exchange-rate appreciation, and contributed to a reduction in trade surpluses.  Thus, other macroeconomic factors can significantly strengthen or weaken the observed relationship between changes in the exchange rate and the trade deficit.  Changes in exchange rates have also helped reduce the U.S. trade deficit in recent years.  Between the third quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1989, the U.S. trade deficit declined 43% in volume terms, in the wake of a strong depreciation in the U.S. dollar.  Because the dollar depreciation initially raised the cost of U.S. imports, declines in the volume of the trade deficit (which more accurately reflect the impact of exchange-rate changes on trade flows) were not reflected in declines in its dollar value until after 1987.  "Pace" Prof.  Chipman, they certainly have been evident since then.  Although exchange-rate changes matter, we have seen that other macroeconomic factors (such as investment, government spending and growth) also affect trade.  As a result, efforts to reduce trade surpluses in Taiwan and Korea will be less effective if exchange-rate appreciation is not accompanied by macroeconomic policies that stimulate demand and increase imports in these two economies.  By the same token, the appreciation of the currencies of Taiwan and Korea (and those of other countries) against the U.S. dollar will be less effective if the U.S. doesn't right its own fiscal ship.  In the absence of proper macroeconomic policies in the U.S., Taiwan's and Korea's trade surpluses will only be shifted to other economies, and U.S. trade deficits may persist. ---  Mr. Moreno is an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Creates  A Chip That's Brainier  COMPUTERS ARE brilliant at calculating, but even the most powerful ones are tied in knots by things an infant can do easily, such as distinguishing between two voices.  A solution to computers' pattern-recognition problems may lie in neural nets, thousands of tiny connections modeled on the workings of the brain.  Up to this point, however, neural-net enthusiasts have lacked adequate hardware.  Those days could be over.  Intel Corp., which produced the first microprocessor in the 1970s, has built the first neural chip powerful enough for an entire computer.  The company says the chip can perform 10,000 separate multiplications simultaneously and a total of two billion per second.  That's more than some multimillion-dollar supercomputers can do.  Intel's chip uses a type of memory known as non-volatile, which means it doesn't lose its "brains" when the electricity gets turned off.  That, plus its computing power, gives the chip a brain-like ability to compare, contrast and store patterns.  Like most five-year-olds, "it can easily recognize all the letters of the alphabet," says Mark Holler, the neural chip's chief architect.  Intel says it isn't ready to market the chip, or guess at its price.  But the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker is evaluating potential uses with a number of customers and already has provided a small quantity of the chips to the U.S. Navy.  Navy researchers, who helped with the chip's design, are studying its use in a number of classified, non-nuclear weapons systems; they also have built a computer that will have the chip at its heart.  The chip could, among other things, improve a missile's ability to hit targets.  CDs to Store Data Are  Music to Auditors' Ears BURIED UNDER books, auditors at some accounting firms are increasingly being drawn to compact disks for computer storage.  The use of compact disks for information storage has caught on well with libraries, but so far business has been cool to adopt this much-ballyhooed technology.  Now, though, CD storage is receiving a boost from auditors, who are beginning to trade in their fat volumes of tax and auditing rules for slim compact-disk players.  The disks are the same as those used for music, but contain data rather than sound.  The "player" is also different.  Arthur Andersen & Co. started the trend late last year, and already has outfitted 1,200 audit teams with CD players.  This month, Price Waterhouse expects to begin distributing 1,000 CD players to auditors.  "With the proliferation of literature in the accounting area, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find citations and be sure your research is complete," says Arthur Siegel, vice chairman of accounting and auditing services at Price Waterhouse.  "CD is an ideal solution."  Mr. Siegel thinks Price ultimately will buy another 3,000 CD players.  Meanwhile, several other big accounting firms are expected to begin experimenting with the use of CDs for auditors, says Robert P. Rainier, director of publications for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  CD storage has its drawbacks, however.  Indexing of audit materials, which come from various sources, remains time consuming and isn't foolproof.  And to keep abreast of new rulings, accounting firms must distribute fresh disks to auditors as frequently as every three months.  New Software Invites  Designers Into Designs  JUST A FEW YEARS ago, many engineers thought it a big deal to trade in pencils and paper for computers that enabled them to design on a desk-top screen.  With computers, they could tinker, test and perfect work on screens before costly prototyping.  What's more, the fancy systems showed animated designs in three dimensions.  Now, Autodesk Inc. of Sausalito, Calif., is betting that engineers will want to go further -- getting inside the design itself.  Autodesk, which sells software used by mechanical designers, began work in June on a product that creates a design netherworld called "hyperspace."  When coupled with a high-powered computer and special electronic eyeglasses and gloves, the software gives, say, an architect the impression that he's walking inside the building he's designing.  "This gives (architects and designers) the power to build an environment, explore it and maybe do some designing on the fly," says William Bricken, director of Autodesk's research laboratory.  "He definitely has the feeling of going somewhere and coming back."  How quickly the company's hyperspace software hits the market depends on prices for the required hardware falling sharply.  Right now, the cost of the helmet and glove exceeds $100,000.  Odds and Ends  BLACK BACKGROUNDS on computer displays may hinder productivity, according to new research by James Sheedy, a clinical associate professor at the University of California's Berkeley School of Optometry.  Mr. Sheedy, the author of numerous studies on computer displays, reports that users perform 8% faster on screens that have black characters on a white background, compared with white on black. . . .

Daewoo International Corp. agreed to a $34 million settlement of a dispute with the U.S. government over steel imports from South Korea.  The court-approved settlement ends a fight between Daewoo, a Carlstadt, N.J., unit of Daewoo Corp. of South Korea and the federal government that began in the early 1980s.  The government alleged that Daewoo overstated the prices of its steel imports in filings with the U.S. Customs Service to avoid charges of dumping.  The Justice Department said the settlement, which will be paid over 10 years, is the largest civil penalty ever imposed for alleged violations of U.S. customs law.  Previously, the largest penalty was $25 million that Volkswagen AG's U.S. subsidiary agreed to pay to settle a customs fraud case in 1982.  In the same year, the Japanese trading firms Mitsui & Co. and Marubeni Corp. agreed to pay $11 million and $2 million, respectively, to settle separate complaints involving steel imports.  A Daewoo spokesman said the company agreed to the settlement, roughly 20% of the government's $163 million claim, after contesting the government's charges.  Judge Nicholas Tsoucalas of the Court of International Trade here approved the settlement yesterday and dismissed the government claim.  Chris-Craft Industries Inc. said it will require Warner Communications Inc. to spin off Warner's 42.5% stake in Chris-Craft's BHC Inc. to shareholders of Time Warner Inc.  The disposition of Warner's shares in BHC, Chris-Craft's principal broadcasting subsidiary, was one of the principal issues in a lawsuit Chris-Craft filed against Warner in Delaware chancery court.  Chris-Craft, which owns 57.5% of BHC, had several other options to choose from, including buying the stake back from Warner or having Warner sell the shares in a public offering.  Chris-Craft is also Warner's biggest shareholder.  It couldn't be learned how the spinoff would be structured or what reaction Warner had to Chris-Craft's decision.  Still in dispute between Chris-Craft and Warner in the Delaware court is whether Chris-Craft is entitled to increase its ownership interest in BHC when the Time Warner merger is completed.  Chris-Craft maintains that it is entitled to increase its stake to 62.1%.  Earlier this week, when BHC received about $1.5 billion pursuant to the Time Warner merger, BHC said it intends to expand its operations in the media, entertainment and communications industries and to explore business opportunities in other industries.  BHC owns and operates seven television stations that make up the nation's ninth largest broadcasting group.  House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski's compromise plan for cutting the capital gains tax is being enthusiastically received inside the Bush administration.  But administration officials won't embrace the plan publicly for fear of alienating their allies on Capitol Hill.  Mr. Rostenkowski's plan, unveiled earlier this week, would remove from taxation that part of a gain that is attributable to inflation.  As an alternative, it would also offer a special tax break on assets held for five years, and a more generous break on assets held for 10 years.  The plan would reduce the effective tax rate to as little as 14% for some high-return, venture capital investments -- even less than the 15% rate originally proposed by President Bush.  "It's a very powerful incentive," one administration official said.  In addition, the proposal would encourage investors to hold on to their assets for five or 10 years, a goal favored by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.  Mr. Rostenkowski's plan has won few plaudits from the advocates of a capital gains tax-cut in Congress.  "There are a lot of objections to it," Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, senior GOP member of the Ways and Means Committee, said this week.  But the administration's enthusiastic response suggests that the Rostenkowski plan might be the starting point of a compromise that could win House approval.  Mr. Archer is one of 13 Republicans and six Democrats on the committee -- a majority of the panel -- who are backing a plan proposed by Rep. Edgar Jenkins (D., Ga.).  That plan would cut the top tax rate on capital gains to 19.6% for 2 1/2 years.  Afterward, the rate would rise to 28%, and the gain attributable to inflation wouldn't be taxed.  Currently capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income rate, which can be as high as 33%.  President Bush has publicly backed the Jenkins plan, and administration officials say they will continue to work with Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Archer and their other allies in Congress.  "They stood by us," one administration official said.  "Now we want to stand by them."  Moreover, administration officials say they have no reason yet to believe the Rostenkowski plan will win over House Speaker Thomas Foley or other Democratic opponents of a capital gains tax cut.  But in private, several administration officials acknowledged yesterday that they prefer Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal to Mr. Jenkins's.  They say it does more to encourage entrepreneurial investment and it provides a greater incentive to invest for the long term.  Budget Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary Brady met with the Ways and Means chairman on several occasions while the Illinois Democrat was fashioning his proposal, and it apparently was designed, in part, to meet their concerns.  One reason some members of Congress don't like the Rostenkowski plan is because it applies only to assets purchased after the law takes effect.  For timber investors, for instance, Mr. Rostenkowski's tax break would apply only to trees planted in the future.  Mr. Jenkins's proposal would apply to any asset sold in the next 2 1/2 years.  But administration policy makers point out that if the purpose of the capital gains tax break is to encourage investment, there's no point in giving it to investments that have already been made.  The Rostenkowski plan, they note, would give the tax break only for new investments.  The debate over capital gains is being driven in part by revenue concerns.  According to Joint Tax Committee estimates, the Jenkins proposal would raise $2.5 billion in revenue next year by encouraging people to sell their assets and pay taxes at the lower rate.  The Rostenkowski plan would bring in only $1.18 billion.  But over the next five years, the Jenkins plan would result in a revenue loss of $1.9 billion, the committee said, while the Rostenkowski plan would lose only $136 million.  Mr. Rostenkowski's plan would allow investors who had held an asset for five years to choose, instead of inflation indexing, to pay tax on only 75% of the sales price of the investment.  For assets held 10 years or more, the investor could choose to pay tax on only 50% of the sales price.  For venture capital investments and other investments that earn large returns, the value of that alternative is considerable.  The effective tax rate on an asset earning a 40% annual rate of return and held for 10 years, for instance, would be only 15%, according to calculations by Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice.

A former lawyer for Burlington Northern Railroad Inc. agreed to pay $48,000 to settle insider-trading charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Richard Schreiber with buying stock and options in the railroad's then-parent, Burlington Northern Inc., after he had been told by management of plans to restructure the company.  The SEC said Mr. Schreiber was the company's senior labor lawyer.  Mr. Schreiber bought stock in Burlington Northern in March 1988, after being told about the possible restructuring, and bought options in May after learning the restructuring would be announced on June 2, 1988, the SEC alleged.  Mr. Schreiber agreed to pay $24,000 representing unlawful profits and another $24,000 as a civil penalty.  In the restructuring, Burlington Northern spun off its oil, gas and minerals divisions, which now make up Burlington Resources Inc., Seattle.  Burlington Northern Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, was left with the railroad.  A spokesman for Burlington Northern said Mr. Schreiber retired from the company on June 15, 1988.  He said the SEC's investigation began six months after that.  "We view this as a personal matter that doesn't have any effect or impact on the company," the spokesman said.  Mr. Schreiber couldn't be reached for comment.  Sales of North American-made cars and trucks fell 5.8% in late July compared with a year ago, as both General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. sales fell sharply despite heavy discounting.  The latest results mean auto makers, who've struggled all year to prop up the market, aren't out of trouble yet.  After a dismal June, Detroit needed a very strong July to clear out burgeoning inventories of 1989 models and allow idled plants to get back to work.  To that end, the Big Three sweetened rebates on many of their models, offering an average of $800 to $1,200 off sticker prices, analysts estimate.  The discounting helped push sales of domestic cars for the month of July to an annual selling pace of about 7.6 million vehicles, up sharply from June's weak seven million annual rate.  But the latest month's pace was still below the 7.7 million annual selling rate reached a year ago, when rebates were less generous.  Moreover, consumers may be buying now to avoid sharp price increases expected on 1990 models due out this fall.  "Sales could be decent for the rest of the summer, and then they'll come in with the {higher-priced} 1990s, and sales will fall out of bed," said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst David Healy.  The result, he said, could be bloated inventories at year's end.  Dealers, meanwhile, say they're more optimistic now that interest rates are dropping.  But the market is still spotty.  In Staten Island, N.Y., "people seem very overcautious," said George Buzzetta, director of operations for Angiulli Buick, part of a group that includes Dodge, Mazda, Jeep/Eagle and Isuzu franchises.  "We found July to be a disappointment," with sales down 20% from July 1988, Mr. Buzzetta said.  But in suburban Cleveland, business at Bass Chevrolet has been "excellent . . . we're up about 15% over a year ago," said general manager Tom Cinalli.  Overall, however, business was down for both the month and the latest 10 days from year-ago levels.  During the latest 10 days, the nine auto makers that build vehicles in North America sold a total of 226,698 domestically built cars, down 6.5% from a year ago.  The seasonally adjusted annual sales pace for the latest 10 days was 7.5 million cars, down from a 7.8 million car pace a year ago.  Among the auto makers hit hardest: Chrysler, GM, and several major foreign auto makers, including Toyota Motor Corp. which suffered a 20% drop in total vehicle sales in July.  Chrysler, which last week moved to slash $1 billion out of its corporate cost structure and lay off 2,300 workers, continued to struggle.  Chrysler's share of the total U.S. car market in July dropped to about 9.4%, the lowest level since August 1987.  The company's car sales fell 14.4% during the month, and total vehicle sales for the month declined 8.6% from a year ago.  GM also had a weak July, continuing to lose ground in the car market.  GM's share dropped to 34.8% in July from 35.2% a year ago.  GM's total car sales slipped 2.8% in the month, while truck sales rose 1.6%.  During the latest 10 days, however, the No. 1 U.S. auto maker's car sales fell 13.1% and truck sales were down 8.4%.  One of GM's big problems is Chevrolet, its largest division.  Chevy's car sales were down 9.5% in the latest 10 days, and the division has yet to get a substantial lift from its new and heavily promoted 1990 Lumina sedan.  In the latest 10 days, combined sales of the Lumina and the seven-year-old Celebrity sedan totaled 7,641 cars, 2.6% less than combined sales of the Celebrity and the now-discontinued Monte Carlo a year ago.  The Lumina is designed to replace both the Monte Carlo and the Celebrity in Chevy's lineup.  Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, managed to boost its total car and light truck sales in both the month and the latest 10 days.  Ford's car sales rose 2.9% during July, despite a slight 0.4% drop in the latest 10 days.  Ford's share of the car market rose to 23% from 22%.  The No. 2 U.S. auto maker's truck sales rose 3.6% during the month, and 3% in the latest 10 days.  Ford may have profited from delaying the extension of its customer rebates until Tuesday.  At Beaman Lincoln-Mercury in Nashville, Tenn., sales "picked up a lot" during the last 10 days of July, and customers eager to beat the rebate deadline had a lot to do with it, said Roger Neely, general sales manager.  The industry's sales of imported cars, meanwhile, fell 5.5% during July from a year ago.  The seasonally adjusted annual selling pace for imported cars dropped to 2.7 million vehicles from 2.98 million.  Toyota was a major factor in that decline, as sales of its imported models fell 33.1%.  The nearly 20,000 car decline offset strong sales of U.S. built Toyotas, which more than doubled in July to 16,171 cars from 6,434.  Many of the big European names continued to struggle in July.  BMW's sales dropped 15.6%, while Volkswagen AG's sales fell 11.7%.  However, Volkswagen's Audi line boosted sales 61.5% in July to 2,653 vehicles.  The rebound came in the wake of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's announcement in mid-July that it had found no mechanical defect in Audi 5000 models that could have caused the cars to suddenly accelerate out of control.  Publicity about sudden acceleration in that now-discontinued model line had stained Audi's image and helped to depress sales for nearly three years.  Audi is also offering heavily subsidized leases to bring in customers and recently extended that program.  ---  @ TOTAL MONTH AUTO SALES FOR JULY  @ RETAIL U.S. CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK SALES-a  @ 1989 1988 %Chg. 1989 1988  @ Jul.

Chairman Lloyd Bentsen of the Senate Finance Committee proposed to limit federal tax refunds for corporate leveraged buy-outs.  The Texas Democrat introduced legislation yesterday that would reduce the amount of losses that can be carried back for tax purposes by corporations that replace equity with debt.  In leveraged buy-outs and certain corporate restructurings, companies often take on large amounts of debt to buy back stock.  In the early years after these transactions, interest on the debt sometimes wipes out profit.  Under the Bentsen bill, companies that have enough losses because of this kind of debt to claim refunds of taxes paid on previous years' profit would be prevented from claiming those refunds.  Instead, they would have to deduct the losses against profit in future years.  The bill would apply to transactions that are currently in the works or that are completed after yesterday.  It's estimated that the legislation would raise $200 million in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, and $1.8 billion over five years.  To cover a shortfall in its domestic savings, the U.S. throughout the 1980s has tapped surpluses from other countries by bidding up interest rates in the world capital market.  The appropriate accounting measure of this savings transfer, and buildup of indebtedness to foreigners, is the current-account deficit: net trade flows (the biggest item), interest payments and gifts.  In 1988, this deficit was about $135 billion or 2.7% of American GNP.  Assuming that the world capital market remains open, will devaluing the dollar succeed in reducing that number?  Equivalently, will American pressure on higher-saving countries -- not only big ones like Germany and Japan but small ones like South Korea and Taiwan -- to permit the dollar values of their currencies to appreciate limit the buildup of their financial claims on the U.S.?  If so, this would be tantamount to asserting that a devaluation of the dollar would increase American savings relative to domestic investment -- and reduce foreign savings relative to investment abroad.  Sound implausible?  Well it is.  Under floating exchange rates, a general fall in the dollar against hard foreign monies can be engineered only by an easier money policy by the Federal Reserve, or by the anticipation of international investors that the Fed intends to become easier -- as Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted in his July 20 report to Congress.  But private American savings are hardly likely to increase if people expect the future American price level to be higher than previously thought.  For example, consider the fall of the dollar from about 2.46 marks and 200 yen at the end of 1985, when prices of a sample basket of wholesale goods were in approximate equilibrium across across the three countries, to about 1.78 marks and 126 yen at the end of 1988.  Americans reacted by stepping up the pace of current spending for both consumption and investment before the full (lagged) increases in the dollar costs of consumption and investment goods adjusted fully.  This "perverse" fall in private savings could explain the failure of the U.S. current-account deficit to fall significantly.  Despite the substantial reduction in the federal fiscal deficit from $213 billion in 1986 to $150 billion in 1988, the current account deficit barely budged: it was $139 billion in 1986 and $135 billion in 1988.  So much for a general devaluation of the U.S. dollar.  What about the U.S. government's remarkable recent policy of pressuring smaller, highly successful Asian economies with current account surpluses to revalue their currencies against the greenback?  The trade law enacted last year says the Treasury secretary must "consider whether countries manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the U.S. dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade."  Even prior to the 1988 act, the Treasury pressured both the Korean and Taiwan governments, whose units are pegged to the U.S. dollar, to revalue their currencies.  From the end of 1985 to the end of 1988, the dollar fell from 890 to 684 Korean won, and from 39.9 to 28.2 New Taiwan dollars.  However, not much change occurred in the combined current-account surpluses of the two countries.  Korea's surplus rose from $4.6 billion in 1986 to about $12.5 billion in 1988, while Taiwan's fell from $16.2 billion in 1986 to $10.2 billion in 1988.  Thus, the domestic savings-investment balance evolved somewhat differently in Taiwan than in Korea, but their similar "forced" exchange appreciations against the dollar cannot explain this difference.  However, the American government remains unconvinced and unsatisfied.  A General Accounting Office study in May on the sources of the U.S. trade deficit states, "Since 1985, the New Taiwan dollar and Korean won have appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar.  However, the U.S. government maintains that these currencies are still undervalued because of central bank intervention, capital market controls, and administrative practices used by the Taiwanese and South Korean governments to achieve a competitive advantage."  Clearly, the American government cannot yet candidly admit that the burdensome buildup of U.S. foreign debt reflects the savings deficiency at home above all.  This deficiency cannot be eliminated by adjusting exchange rates nor by attacking the foreign trade policies of other countries that generate the corresponding, badly needed surpluses.  It is surely true that exchange-rate changes can influence some economic variables.  First, for a country like the U.S., a devaluation may well improve its "real" trade balance -- when exports and imports are separately deflated for price changes.  Exports become cheaper on world markets, and their physical volume increases relative to imports.  But because the terms of trade turn against the devaluing country (the price of imports increases relative to exports), the current account deficit and the buildup of foreign indebtedness are not predictably affected.  Second, price inflation in Taiwan and Korea is likely to be less because of a forced exchange appreciation -- unless it is offset by a loss of internal financial control.  Sure enough, short-run monetary management in both Taiwan and Korea has been greatly disturbed.  In anticipation of the well-telegraphed rise of their currencies, huge but probably temporary inflows of financial capital have distorted domestic money supplies and credit flows.  Now Korea in particular faces a severe problem in adjusting to a wage explosion in 1988 and 1989 that a forced exchange appreciation greatly complicates.  Because of this unwarranted American interference in their internal financial affairs, these fledgling democracies have seen a considerable loss of political goodwill -- without any corresponding benefit to the U.S.  ---  Mr. McKinnon is a professor of international economics at Stanford.  (See related story: "The Trade Balance..." -- WSJ Aug. 4, 1989)  The Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning strict new rules to monitor private mortgage bankers that participate in HUD's loss-ridden coinsurance program.  Federal investigators have estimated that the coinsurance program, which is run by the Federal Housing Administration, has accumulated losses of $1 billion from mismanagement, fraud and waste.  HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has responded by suspending the most troubled coinsurers and placing a moratorium on any new coinsurers.  The new head of the FHA pledged that the companies, which assume 19% of the risk of insuring a mortgage, would be closely watched and swiftly dealt with in the future.  "If they don't perform, they should be permitted out {of the program} very quickly, and that wasn't done," C. Austen Fitts, the new FHA chief, said before the Senate Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs.  The FHA will seek detailed information on insurers' financial condition, capital position and net worth, Ms. Fitts said.  The new rules will be part of a wide-ranging restructuring of the program to take place at the end of the moratorium in September.  Federal investigators and auditors from Price Waterhouse have traced much of the losses to lenders' inflated assessments of mortgaged property.  Under the program, private lenders received a lucrative fee linked to the value of the property -- allowing them to pay off their 19% stake on defaulted mortgages and still come away with a profit.  Ms. Fitts argued that the FHA, the most loss-plagued agency within HUD, could get back on its feet through managerial and legislative reform.  HUD action will often be sufficient in the short run, she said, but "legislation may be necessary to ensure that these practices endure beyond the tenure of the current administration."  Malfunctions and design defects in heart pacemakers and other medical devices have caused numerous injuries and deaths that have gone unreported to the Food and Drug Administration, a public health group says.  FDA records show that at least 35 manufacturers have flouted a law that requires them to report promptly any malfunction that results in death or serious injury, according to Public Citizen Health Research Group.  The group said another 33 companies failed to meet the reporting deadline.  Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Washington-based advocacy group, said "gross underreporting" of malfunctions and design defects undermines the FDA's early-warning system for detecting patterns of potential problems and initiating recalls of malfunctioning devices.  As a result, dangerous devices remain in use, he said, adding: "It may be costing a large number of lives."  At the same time, Dr. Wolfe faulted the FDA for waiting eight years to begin enforcing the 1976 law and for failing to prosecute any companies for reporting violations.  The agency is engaged in an "educational caper," he asserted.  "They're educating the device industry that it is perfectly all right to break the law."  William Grigg, a spokesman for the FDA, took issue with the group's findings.  "This is a fairly new reporting system," he said.  "We are getting 15,000 reports a year . . .  We think we're getting reasonable cooperation from the industry.  The system has allowed us to do several quick recalls."  Public Citizen based its study on FDA documents it obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.  These included reports on routine inspections of manufacturers between December 1985 and June 1988 and so-called notices of adverse findings that the agency sent them for failing to report deaths, injuries and malfunctions.  Dr. Wolfe belittled these notices as a "slap on the wrist."  During the period reviewed by the group, FDA inspectors found in company files records of seven deaths, 109 serious injuries and 265 malfunctions and one design defect that should have been passed on to the FDA, according to Dr. Wolfe.  In one case involving apparent alarm failures on an infant respiration and heartrate monitor, four infants died and four others suffered serious injuries, the group's study found.  In another case, 178 malfunctions -- including ones that resulted in two deaths and one serious injury -- were linked to use of an intra-aortic balloon catheter, an implant that helps the heart pump blood.  In addition, the group said, at least 31 serious injuries resulted from leaking breast prostheses.  Public Citizen also uncovered unreported cases of malfunctioning or defective pacemakers, wheel chairs, oxygen masks, crutches and defibrillators, which are used to restart heart beats.  Yesterday, the group asked Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) to investigate the appearent breakdown in the reporting system and the FDA's enforcement performance.  Messrs.  Dingell and Kennedy are chairmen of subcommittees that oversee the FDA.  Mr. Grigg, the FDA spokesman, said that the agency will take a "second look" at the companies that didn't file reports as required.  "We don't have any reason to believe any of these cases were hidden from the FDA," he added.  Yesterday's announcement by Hezbollah that it had, in effect, suspended the execution of Joseph Cicippio was phrased in a way that might be of future interest to Americans concerned about how to fight terrorism.  "Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, we declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution with an initiative," said the Hezbollah statement.  In other words, there are some people in the world for whom the terrorists have respect.  The way to bring pressure on terrorists is to bring pressure on their masters.  Iran obviously was first choice.  In the language of diplomatic niceties, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler yesterday said, "We have been in touch with Iran through a variety of channels and at this time have no reason to believe that Iran is not dealing with this matter in a serious way."  More to the point, the Associated Press quoted an anonymous administration official Wednesday to the effect that Iran had been told: "If anything happens to the hostages we hold you responsible."  In other words, it may be hard to find out where terrorists are hiding -- although we are not convinced that it is impossible -- but it is always possible to know the address of a sponsoring government.  Moammar Gadhafi learned that lesson when he narrowly escaped U.S. Air Force F-111s three years ago.  In the case of the Hezbollah, there are most likely several governments with some degree of responsibility.  Certainly the long, bloody arm of Iran's late ruler, the Ayatollah Khomeini, manipulated the Hezbollah fanatics.  But they also were operating from territory controlled, if you can call it that, by another shadowy character, Hafez al-Assad of Syria.  And Syria is a client state of the Soviet Union, which even under glasnost has not forsworn the employment of KGB intrigues to further its intricate global ambitions.  Ms. Tutwiler indicated that these other two players also were consulted in U.S. diplomatic efforts to save Mr. Cicippio.  What motives each might have to cooperate are subject to speculation.  Soviet overtures to the West are founded heavily on its own deep economic problems, for example.  But Iran, at least, probably has some understanding of the potential cost of noncooperation, given the enmity it has earned in such generous quantities from the American people and government.  So the terrorists are showing some "respect."  The crisis isn't over, as presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made clear yesterday.  The terrorists still are demanding that the Israelis release their top fanatic, Abdul Karim Obeid, and now have proposed to give a longer list of names to the Red Cross.  Maybe they are in a mood to deal.  Maybe they are not.  But if they are not, their friends in Tehran and elsewhere should keep in mind that states can be held responsible for the forces they unleash on the world.  Sometimes the calling to account is less than pleasant.  Melvin L. Hecktman, 49 years old, a director of this office products wholesaler, was named to the new post of vice chairman.  These senior vice presidents were named executive vice presidents in their respective divisions: Marshall A. Gardner, 49, finance; Ronald W. Weissman, 52, logistics; and Robert W. Welnhofer, 56, marketing.  No doubt it is frustrating to see that men and women spend so much of their daily lives struggling with such matters as S&L bailouts and homicidal fanatics in Lebanon.  "Where will it all end?" is the common plaint of the pessimists.  So it might be worth drawing attention to another of man's endeavors that is performing spectacularly well -- more than 2.7 billion miles from Earth.  It's the U.S. spacecraft Voyager 2, which was launched 12 years ago, has flown by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, and now is discovering the mysteries of Neptune.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced yesterday that this little explorer, though 22 million miles from Neptune, has just discovered three previously unknown moons around the planet.  We don't imagine that mankind will derive any immediate utility from knowing this.  We're certain, though, that the mere act of sending this small ship 2.7 billion miles to discover something that the day before had never been known by anyone is an important event.  It is proof that mankind's daily problems can't deter its movement forward to the unknown, and that it makes this effort in the hope that something good will come of it.  Bruce R. Bond was named director of corporate strategy.  He is currently vice president of strategic planning at U S West Inc.  He will join British Telecom later this month, succeeding Tony Vardy, who is moving to a yet-unannounced senior business management post within the communications-systems division, the company said.  The concern, which has a large stake in McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., has been aggressively pushing into the U.S. telecommunications market.  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against two investors, charging them with an allegedly improper stock-transaction scheme.  In a suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the agency charged that the investors made buy orders for shares through accounts with insufficient funds and then paid for the stock the next day, after selling the shares at a profit.  If the stock declined sharply the next day, the investors didn't pay, not having enough money in their accounts to cover the purchases, the SEC said in the suit.  Jury Matt Hansen and Fergus M. Sloan Jr. were named in the suit.  Also charged were Fermat Associates, a partnership the defendants formed, and Graycliff International, which the SEC says the defendants used to conduct the transactions.  Messrs.  Hansen and Sloan are alleged to have made a profit of at least $1 million on the transactions, the SEC says.  The agency charges that the transactions were executed from 1984 until recently, through 250 accounts under 76 fictitious names at more than 100 broker-dealers.  The SEC also accused Toronto Dominion Bank of illegally extending credit to the defendants for the stock purchases.  The SEC says the defendants provided the bank with corporate resolutions from Graycliff, guaranteeing the debt of the brokerage accounts.  The SEC said the alleged transactions caused losses of at least $1.5 million for four broker-dealers.  The SEC asks that Messrs.  Hansen and Sloan disgorge all allegedly illicit profits.  Federal Judge Richard Owen ordered that the assets of Messrs.  Hansen and Sloan be temporarily frozen.  Toronto Dominion said that it was "an innocent bystander" and that it has been cooperating with the SEC's inquiry.  Elliot Schnapp, an attorney at the firm representing Messrs.  Hansen and Sloan, said the stock transactions were legal.  Mr. Schnapp also said the two men never failed to pay for stock purchases they ordered.  Thomas P. Romig was named senior vice president, marketing services and entertainment, succeeding John Weems, who resigned.  Mr. Romig previously was vice president, marketing and business development, baked goods.  Mattel makes toys and hobby products.  John J. Lynch, a former chairman of Adams-Russell Inc. who joined this maker of microwave and communications products after the companies' recent merger, was elected president and chief operating officer.  As operating chief, he succeeds Richard W. Hale, who remains group vice president.  As president, Mr. Lynch succeeds Thomas F. Burke, who remains chairman and chief executive officer.  Messrs.  Lynch and Hale also were elected directors, expanding board membership to 14.  Gregory H. Adamian, president of Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., and Edward M. Tavlin, senior vice president of Josephthal & Co., New York, were named directors of this transportation leasing services concern, expanding board membership to nine.  President Bush seems to be leaning toward a veto of the savings-and-loan bailout bill that the House passed yesterday by a 22-vote margin.  His major objection is to the bill's provision putting the bailout's costs on budget, where it can be used as a rhetorical trampoline by people jumping up and down for a tax increase.  This bill ought to be vetoed, but there are other good reasons for doing so.  The bill not only fails to address the underlying causes of the S&L mess, but also it provides political cover for key Members who intervened with federal regulators to go easy on high-flying thrifts that since have crashed.  Last week, California Senator Alan Cranston, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, provided the decisive conference vote that will allow the top federal S&L regulator, M. Danny Wall, to continue in his job without reconfirmation by the Senate.  At any new confirmation hearings, Mr. Wall surely would have faced questions about his role in delaying regulatory action against Lincoln Savings & Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which since has failed and will wind up costing taxpayers $2.5 billion.  Such questions also would have been very uncomfortable for Senator Cranston and four other senators -- John Glenn, Dennis DeConcini, Donald Riegle and John McCain -- who joined him in accepting large contributions from Lincoln's owner, Charles Keating, and then intervened with regulators on Lincoln's behalf.  Ed Gray, former head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, says the Senators asked him in April 1987 to drop a key regulation opposed by Mr. Keating -- "a clear subversion of the regulatory process."  Now it turns out that at least two of the five Senators -- Messrs.  Cranston and Glenn-are far more indebted to Mr. Keating than was known previously.  Mr. Cranston solicited $850,000 from Mr. Keating for three voter-registration groups.  Such groups are billed as nonpartisan, but they tend to largely register Democrats.  Registration efforts are credited by Senator Cranston for his narrow 1986 re-election victory.  The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Senator Cranston was so eager to raise money for the groups that "he didn't just hose people down, he used a water cannon."  He refuses to release the names of other contributors he solicited money from.  Curiously, one of the groups was founded by Senator Cranston's son, and its chairman is a former judge whose law firm represents Keating business interests and is a co-defendant in a class-action suit filed against Lincoln's parent company.  California Assemblyman Pat Johnston, a Democrat, plans to hold hearings on the issue later this month.  For his part, Senator Glenn solicited $200,000 in contributions from Mr. Keating for his National Council on Public Policy, a group that paid for Mr. Glenn to travel around the country and expound his views.  The council raised a total of only $16,000 from other sources, with the Keating $200,000 contribution arranged by a former Glenn staffer who had become Mr. Keating's corporate counsel.  The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports $43,800 of the Keating money was used to pay expenses of the Glenn Senate campaign -- a possible violation of federal law.  These revelations have angered lawyers for the 23,000 Lincoln customers who hold some $255 million in subordinated debentures - -unsecured, high-risk bonds -- that were sold by Lincoln's parent company, American Continental.  They became nearly worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy, putting the bondholders in back of a long line of creditors.  In class-action suits filed against Lincoln, lawyers for the bondholders plan to focus attention on the actions of Senator Cranston and his colleagues.  Lincoln wasn't closed by regulators until April 1989.  Had it been shut down as had been suggested in 1987, taxpayers would have saved more than $1 billion and all but $3 million of the $255 million in subordinated debentures would not have been sold.  Senator Cranston has performed some elaborate gymnastics to deflect attention from his Lincoln lobbying.  Having avoided a messy reconfirmation for Mr. Wall, he now is working to have the federal government bail out the Lincoln bondholders as if they were covered by deposit insurance.  That would end the class-action suits that might turn up further details of his ties to Mr. Keating.  Whatever the outcome of the bailout bill itself, President Bush ought to insist that Congress not sweep aside the role that public officials and Members of Congress from Jim Wright, Tony Coelho and Alan Cranston on down played in creating the crisis.  The S&L bailout is going to cost every taxpayer at least $1,500.  The least they should get in return is a complete explanation of how their pockets were picked.  A group of Soviet and Western economists unveiled a detailed plan to make the ruble fully convertible by the year 2000.  The economists said the restructuring of the Soviet economy ultimately can't succeed if the ruble isn't freely traded.  A nonconvertible ruble means foreign firms earning the currency don't have any easy way of getting profits out of the Soviet Union.  In addition, Soviet citizens can't use their rubles to buy foreign currency to use in turn to buy foreign goods.  A group of economists from the U.S., Canada, France and Moscow's Institute for the Study of the U.S.A. and Canada produced the plan under the auspices of the Geonomics Institute, a think tank here.  The group said this is the first ruble-convertibility proposal produced by a joint Soviet-Western group and among the first produced anywhere.  The plan will be reviewed by top Soviet officials, economists and bankers.  In October, it will be discussed at a conference here attended by U.S. and Soviet officials and business people, including top officials from Gosbank, the Soviet equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve.  The plan proposes making the ruble convertible in several steps, beginning immediately with limited auctions of hard foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar.  Initially, only state enterprises could bid for the hard currency, which would be sold by the Soviet government from its $30 billion of existing reserves.  Initially, the auction "exchange rate will be close to the black-market rate," said Vladimir Popov, a senior research fellow at the Institute for the Study of the U.S.A. and Canada.  On the black market the ruble trades at 15 to 17 rubles to the dollar.  The official rate set by the Soviet government is 0.63 rubles to the dollar.  Over time, more state enterprises would be allowed to bid at the auctions as would U.S.-Soviet joint-venture concerns.  Eventually Soviet banks would trade rubles on a daily basis as the ruble-exchange market becomes more like a regular foreign-exchange market.  The 120 Soviet banks will eventually be active in this market, said Alexander Belov, a research fellow at the Soviet institute.  But the economists warned that making the ruble convertible will be a laborious process.  Among the problems is the enormous "overhang" of rubles in the Soviet economy.  Consumers accumulate rubles because they can't find enough to buy.  A convertible ruble could unleash a powerful inflationary effect as people rushed to spend their savings as dollars or francs.  In addition, the Soviet banking system and financial markets must develop the mechanisms -- and bankers the skills -- to deal with a Western-type foreign-exchange market, the economists said.  Robert Van Buren, 60-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Midlantic Corp.; Richard R. West, 51, dean of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University; and Francis P. Lucier, 61, a management consultant, were elected directors of this maker of typewriters and word processors.  The board increases to nine members.  Smith Corona recently was taken public by Hanson PLC, which holds a 47.9% stake and four seats on the board.  The other two directors are Smith Corona officers.  Bond prices stumbled on technical factors while stocks posted meager gains and the dollar strengthened.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.17 points to 2661.61 in moderate trading.  Long-term bond prices slipped amid uncertainty over what the demand will be for new debt next week.  The dollar gained against other major currencies as investors sought safety in the midst of the continuing hostage crisis in the Mideast.  Analysts said most investors are waiting to take their cues from today's July employment statistics, which will provide the first broad look at how the economy fared last month.  Investors will be examining the data for clues to the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy move.  Bond traders said prices slumped yesterday as investors wondered about the reception the Treasury will get for its $29.5 billion of three-year, 10-year and 30-year issues next week.  Because the Treasury is bumping up against current debt limits, there isn't any "when-issued" trading in the proposed issues.  That makes it difficult to tell how easily the market will absorb the new debt.  The dollar rose as traders prepared for the release of today's employment figures and for any escalation of tensions in the Middle East.  In major market activity:  Stock prices edged higher in moderate trading.  Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 169.7 million shares.  Advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners, 874-628.  Bond prices slumped.  The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost seven-eighths of a point, or $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.  The yield on the issue rose to 7.91%.  The dollar strengthened.  In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.8726 marks and 137.25 yen, compared with 1.8588 marks and 136.65 yen late Wednesday.  S. Kent Rockwell, 44, president and chief executive officer, was named to the additional post of chairman of this fabricator of seals for oil-storage tanks.  He succeeds his father, Willard F. Rockwell Jr., 75, who will remain a director and consultant.  Stanley C. Chamberlin, 53-year-old managing director of this travel and financial services company's Lynch, Jones & Ryan institutional broker subsidiary, was named the unit's chairman, to succeed Harry H. Jones, 58, who is to retire Sept. 30.  Dataproducts Corp.'s longtime suitor, DPC Acquisition Partners, reiterated its $15-a-share takeover proposal for the computer printer maker, and also made separate bids to buy certain of Dataproducts' operating units.  DPC, a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc. that currently holds a 7.8% stake in Dataproducts, previously sent a letter to Dataproducts proposing a $15-a-share takeover, but that first proposal was scant on details, a spokesman for Dataproducts said.  DPC gave more concrete details yesterday, saying that at least $10 of the $15-a-share price would be in cash.  The $15-a-share bid has an indicated value of $283.7 million, based on the 18.9 million shares of Dataproducts that DPC doesn't already own.  In addition to the offer for the entire company, DPC made alternative bids for certain of the company's businesses: DPC is proposing to acquire the Dataproducts New England Inc. subsidiary for a combination of $25 million in cash and the 1.5 million Dataproducts shares that it holds; it is also offering to buy both Dataproducts New England and Dataproducts' Supplies Group for $55 million cash and its 7.8% stake.  Dataproducts' investment bankers, Goldman, Sachs & Co., had set a deadline of yesterday for preliminary bids for Dataproducts New England.  DPC said it has obtained "reasonable assurance" from its financial adviser, Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., that financing for its bids can be obtained.  Dataproducts in June agreed to provide DPC with confidential information on the company.  In exchange, DPC agreed to halt its effort to solicit shareholders to remove Dataproducts's board and promised not to start any proxy fight or tender offer during the standstill period.  In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dataproducts shares closed at $12.75, off 25 cents.  James P. Neeves, 52 years old, was elected senior vice president in charge of the corporate administration group of this specialty chemical company.  Formerly a vice president, Mr. Neeves succeeds Brian J. Smith, 45, who recently was elected executive vice president and chief financial officer.  The dollar rose as shortcovering in the currency continued ahead of the release of a major U.S. indicator today.  Tensions surrounding the fate of U.S. hostages in Lebanon fanned the buying of dollars, foreign exchange dealers reported.  But with a variety of reports and other influences tugging at the market, they said, the impact of any single factor is difficult to gauge.  The traders said reductions in short-dollar positions were precautionary.  Trading surrounding today's release of July U.S. employment data could be volatile.  The dollar's rise on position squaring in the past two days hasn't altered the negative outlook for the currency, traders said.  The U.S. Federal Reserve still appears poised to extend a recent series of interest rate reductions, they said.  In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8726 marks, up from 1.8588 marks Wednesday, and at 137.25 yen, up from 136.65 yen.  The pound was at $1.6365, down from $1.6552.  In Tokyo Friday, the dollar opened for trading at 137.08 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 136.40 yen.  The U.S. unit sagged Thursday in Asian trading, but nervousness over the U.S. employment report and tensions in the Middle East prompted renewed dollar purchasing in early European trading.  The U.S. currency climbed steadily when New York trading commenced and spurted higher in last-minute position-squaring when Europe closed and as the deadline for the execution of a U.S. hostage in Beirut drew nearer, traders said.  A radical Shiite revolutionary group in Lebanon had announced that the hostage, Joseph James Cicippio, would be executed yesterday.  Forty-five minutes before the deadline, his captors announced that his killing would be postponed in response to pleas from unnamed third parties.  Traders said the potential for hostilities in the Middle East prompted short-covering in the dollar, a traditional beneficiary in times of instability.  But Earl I. Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, cautioned that the dollar's rise leaves the currency vulnerable to a fall today.  Sterling grabbed attention in European trading yesterday, as heavy selling pressure prompted the Bank of England to intervene twice to support the pound as it sank to near 3.05 marks.  At the New York finish, the pound was trading at 3.0645 marks, down from 3.0760 marks late in New York Wednesday.  On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $3.60 to $373.70 an ounce in moderate trading.  Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.  In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $372.15 an ounce.  Tokyo stocks closed modestly lower in thin dealings as the market failed to focus buying interest, brokers said.  London share prices ended slightly easier as the market struggled in vain to find a clear direction in the face of conflicting signals.  Tokyo's Nikkei average of 225 issues fell 119.53 points to 34779.81.  The index gained 0.88 Wednesday.  Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares, down from 816.7 million Wednesday.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers 600 to 322, while 173 issues remained unchanged.  In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index fell 73.11 points to 34706.70.  On Thursday, stocks in a broad range, including utility and financial issues that gained Wednesday, were sold on profit-taking.  Despite such selling, brokers said the market was dull as many institutional and individual investors moved to the sidelines.  Meanwhile, in London, a price-cutting exercise by market makers, poor company earnings reports, and fresh weakness in the pound combined to depress buying interest, dealers said.  However, news of a fresh #2 billion ($3.32 billion) bid by General Electric and Siemens for Plessey, and a slight upturn on Wall Street, helped support the market at lower levels.  The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down 1.5 points at 2306.3, below the day's high of 2310.3.  At its lowest, the index touched 2298.  At the close, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 0.1 points at 1924.  Turnover was a healthy 550.1 million shares, up from 424.8 million Wednesday.  In Frankfurt, share prices slumped in lively trading amid profit-taking in automobile and banking shares, but chemical issues continued their brisk advance.  Stock prices in Brussels rose across the board in moderate trading, boosting the index to its fourth consecutive record.  Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Milan and Stockholm and mixed in Paris and Amsterdam.  South African gold stocks closed higher.  In Hong Kong, share prices surged 2% in brisk trading, boosted by speculation about an imminent interest-rate cut and growing confidence in the local economy.  The rally propelled the Hang Seng Index through the 2600 barrier, which had blocked rises twice earlier in the week.  In Sydney, shares jumped to a post-crash high.  Offshore buying pushed mining and resource issues sharply higher before a late bout of profit-taking pulled some leading issues back.  In other Asian and Pacific trading, share prices closed higher in Taipei, Wellington and Manila and lower in Seoul and Singapore.  Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.  To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.  The percentage change is since year-end.  @ % This  @ Aug 2 Aug 1 Year  @ U.S. .......................... 317.0 316.4 + 23.8  @ Britain ....................... 697.9 693.4 + 27.8  @ Canada ........................ 432.5 432.0 + 17.8  @ Japan ......................... 1560.2 1557.2 + 9.8  @ France ........................ 527.4 527.6 + 19.1  @ Germany ....................... 250.0 248.1 + 20.2  @ Hong Kong ..................... 1939.6 1936.9 - 4.4  @ Switzerland ................... 225.9 224.6 + 30.6  @ Australia ..................... 332.4 329.8 + 14.5  @ World index ................... 551.2 548.0 + 11.5  Ben Lino was named to the new post of executive vice president of Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Gaithersburg, Md., unit of this pharmaceuticals company.  He remains director of international development for the parent.  The company is trying to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for its acetyl-L-carnitine, or Alcar, drug to treat Alzheimer's disease.  Deutsche Bank AG said group pretax operating profit rose 20% in the first half of this year from one-half of its 1988 operating profit, reflecting cost controls and profit growth in the bank's lending and securities operations.  In keeping with standard West German banking practices, Deutsche Bank declined to quantify full operating earnings in an interim report sent to its 310,000 shareholders.  Bank analysts, however, peg the first-half profit figure at about 2.3 billion marks ($1.24 billion).  Deutsche Bank said about two percentage points of the 20% gain in full operating profit could be attributed to the consolidation for the first time of two foreign acquisitions: Banco Commercial Transatlantico S.A. of Spain and H. Albert de Bary & Co., a small bank in the Netherlands.  Group credit volume stood at 229.21 billion marks ($123.53 billion) as of June 30, up 8.4% from 211.40 billion marks at the end of last year, contributing to a 9.4% rise in total group assets to 334.12 billion marks from 305.30 billion marks over the same period.  The half-year reporting season for West German banks has brought mixed results.  "Deutsche Bank's numbers looked very good in comparison, particularly on a year-to-year basis," said Thomas Albrecht, a German bank analyst for UBS-Phillips & Drew in London.  "It's becoming clear that Deutsche is growing faster than the others, including profitability."  Home Savings of America became the second major thrift to sue the Federal Home Loan Bank board, seeking a judicial decision to allow it to withdraw from the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.  In May, Great Western Financial Corp., of Beverly Hills, Calif., filed suit in Los Angeles federal court following the Bank Board's rejection of an application of its Great Western Bank unit to convert to a federal savings bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  A third giant thrift, Home Federal Savings, a unit of San Diego-based HomeFed Corp., was given permission by the bank board on Tuesday to leave FSLIC.  But the attempts of these three S&Ls to leave FSLIC may all be moot.  Under pending congressional legislation, no thrifts would be allowed to leave FSLIC for a period of five years.  Home Savings, a unit of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., of Los Angeles, is the nation's largest thrift, with assets of $43 billion.  In its suit, also filed in Los Angeles federal district court, the S&L said the Bank Board has yet to act on its application to leave the FSLIC by merging into its much-smaller Bowery Savings Bank subsidiary, whose deposits are already FDIC-insured.  The suit asks the court to order the Bank Board to act favorably on the application, or to rule that Bank Board approval is "not required."  Great Western also planned to gain savings-bank status by merging with Great Western Bank of Bellevue, Wash., a much smaller unit.  The Bank Board, in a ruling that surprised no one, said Great Western hadn't applied for the move in time to exempt itself from 1987 legislation that blocked thrifts from moving to the bank fund for two years.  The agency ruled Home Federal Savings had applied in time.  Attempts by S&Ls to jump to the FDIC are controversial among regulators because they could undermine efforts to replenish the insolvent thrift fund, whose premiums are much higher than FDIC premiums.  Congress is siding with the regulators by incorporating a five-year ban on defections from the FSLIC in a pending bill to finance the closing of many insolvent S&Ls.  Although the bill is being held up in a dispute over its financing provisions, the ban on exiting the FSLIC is expected to remain in the bill, and become law when signed by President Bush.  Retired Army Gen. Roscoe Robinson Jr. was elected a director, increasing the board of this aircraft maker and defense contractor to 12 members.  Emery G. Olcott, president and chief executive officer of Canberra Industries Inc., was named a director of this gas distribution holding company, expanding board membership to six.  Closing in on its August 1987 record, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up to another post-crash high.  The average rose 4.17 to 2661.61, leaving it 60.81 points shy of the peak of 2722.42 that it reached Aug. 25, 1987.  Broader averages, which hit record highs Monday and then eased, showed modest gains yesterday.  The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.40 to 344.74, and the New York Stock Exchange Index advanced 0.31 to 192.09.  Big Board volume was 169,690,000 shares, and advancers led decliners, 874-628.  Technology stocks led the market higher.  International Business Machines rose 1 to 113 3/4, Motorola rose 1 3/4 to 57 3/8 and Compaq Computer gained 2 1/2 to 91 1/2.  Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Stephen Balog said a wave of buyers pursued technology shares this week.  "It's another way to play the soft landing," he said, referring to investors' most hopeful scenario for the U.S. economy.  "If we have only a quarter or two of sluggish growth and then an acceleration, then these stocks look exceptionally cheap."  Recently, defensive stocks, or issues that retain earnings ability in periods of slow growth, have led the market.  But price-earnings ratios of these groups -- drug, food, communications and utility stocks are among the main ones -- now have risen to expensive premiums over the broader market, analysts said.  The cheapest stocks now are those of companies tied to the business cycle, such as technology issues.  Prices of many of those stocks already are trading at recession values.  Motorola, Mr. Balog said as an example, is trading at a discount to many industrial stocks and thus is finding favor among money managers.  Institutional accounts have traded actively this week, traders said.  Some money managers are pursuing undervalued stocks such as technology issues, while others may be standing aside or selling.  The result has been heavy volume, a large amount of block trading and narrow spreads between buying and selling prices.  Today's employment report for July could launch another day of heavy trading if it contains evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic growth.  Estimates are that non-farm payrolls rose about 158,000 last month and that the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3%.  On the most active list yesterday, Walt Disney gained 6 3/8 to 121 after rising 4 7/8 Wednesday.  Analysts are bullish on the stock, and vague takeover rumors continue to circulate among traders.  One analyst said that the stock could trade as high as 165 within a year.  Di Giorgio surged 3 1/4 to 34 after a $32-a-share bid by Rose Partners, a New York-based limited partnership.  Two Big Board stocks gained after being added to the S&P 500, as did one over-the-counter issue.  Ashland Oil gained 1 1/8 to 38 5/8 and Nicor rose 1 3/8 to 39 1/2; Oracle Systems added 1 to 16 3/8 in OTC trading.  The stocks replace ASA, Ideal Basic Industries and Warner Communications, which have been involved in recent takeover agreements.  ASA lost 1/4 to 43 7/8 yesterday, Ideal Basic dropped 3/4 to 1 7/8 and Warner rose 1/4 to 66 7/8.  S&P also added First Interstate Bancorp to its 100-stock index, replacing Warner Communications.  First Interstate gained 1/4 to 63 1/4.  Stocks get an initial boost from being added to the indexes because of buying by managers of index-based portfolios.  Loews surged 3 1/8 to 126 1/8.  The company reported second-quarter net income of $4.38 a share, up from $3.30 a share a year earlier.  CML Group rose 3 1/4 to 26 1/2 after a series of corporate announcements.  The company said it will buy out the remaining two years of its five-year original employment contract with the former owners of its NordicTrack unit.  It said payments due under the existing contract were "masking the underlying earnings power" of its businesses.  The company also said it intends to sell its Boston Whaler and Sybervision units and is negotiating the possible sale of its Carroll Reed subsidiary.  Esterline gained 1 7/8 to 11 7/8.  The company said it expects to report a 50% increase in per-share profit, before a credit for a tax-loss carry-forward, for its third quarter, which ended Monday.  In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned 19 cents a share before a tax credit of three cents a share.  Crane rose 1 5/8 to 29 3/4.  The company said that it was comfortable with analysts' estimates that it will earn $2.60 a share for the year and $2.90 a share next year.  Crane earned $2.19 a share last year.  MCN Corp. slid 3/8 to 20 7/8 after it said it expects to post a larger loss in the third quarter than the $2.5 million it lost in the quarter a year ago.  The American Stock Exchange Index gained 1.34 to 376.82.  Volume totaled 12,820,000 shares.  Bolar Pharmaceutical lost 1 1/4 to 27 3/4, before being halted at about 10:30 a.m. EDT. Trading in the stock didn't resume.  The company is the latest to be accused of substituting another company's drugs as its own in generic version in order to win quick Food and Drug Administration approval.  The charges were made by congressional investigators.  The company denied the allegations.  Dean Kamen, president of DEKA Research & Development Corp., was named a director of this maker of seals and dampers for the computer and semiconductor industries, increasing board membership to six.  Paramount Communications Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp. filed suit in an effort to stop the practice of inserting local commercials onto home-video versions of movies.  The suit, filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wichita, Kan., alleges copyright infringement by Video Broadcasting Systems Inc. of Wichita, which provides the service to two video retailers that rent out tapes and several local businesses that bought advertising on videos of Paramount films.  These concerns were also named.  Legal action was expected to be taken by the large movie studios against this kind of advertising, which was described in this newspaper's advertising column Wednesday.  A Midland, Texas, company, Video Air Time, which splices such commercials into video releases, said it still plans to try to recruit franchisees at next week's Video Software Dealer's Association convention in Las Vegas.  Video Air Time wasn't named in yesterday's suit, but a Paramount spokeswoman said, "We're investigating."  Video Air Time's general counsel, Houston lawyer John C. Osborne, compared the practice to that of an owner of a movie theater who shows local commercials before the trailers begin.  "Once you purchase that video cassette, it's your property," Mr. Osborne said.  In the lawsuit, Paramount says the local businesses have no right to alter its copyright tapes, and that in some cases the local spots overlapped Paramount's own "coming attractions" and even national ads sold by Paramount.  It said the low-budget nature of the local spots tarnished Paramount's reputation.  Paramount is asking for a preliminary injunction and damages of $1 million or all of Video Broadcasting's profit, whichever is higher.

You might think that U.S. diplomats to the United Nations revel in the high life, hobnobbing with foreign officials before being whisked home by limousine to a suite atop a Manhattan skyscraper.  In fact, New York is such a hardship post that key positions in the U.S. mission to the United Nations go begging for applicants.  About a fourth of the foreign service posts and the regular staff positions recruited locally are vacant, says Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering.  "I don't believe that under the current circumstances the mission can fulfill the expectations that people have for us," said Mr. Pickering.  Living conditions for staffers took another drop in July, when housing and tax benefits were eliminated.  Dozens of staffers have become temporarily homeless after being priced out of apartments they can no longer afford.  "Who wants to come to New York and impoverish himself?" said one senior official, one of many mission staffers who has lost an apartment.  "The staff is very, very reduced, it is dangerously low," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  "I don't know how we're going to continue to do our business.  "Today we were at a meeting, and a political counselor stood up and said 'I am the political section today.'"  Important positions at the U.S. mission have been vacant for months or years:  -- The mission has had no Africa expert for two years, and had to enlist its Middle East expert to handle the delicate Security Council negotiations leading to South Africa's agreement to grant independence to Namibia.  -- With the Cambodian crisis coming to a head in September as Vietnam withdraws from that nation, it took the mission nine months to fill the post of east Asian affairs expert.  -- The post of European disarmament affairs expert has been vacant for a year.  -- In two months, the new General Assembly opens, but the mission has lost two experts on Assembly affairs.  One monitored human rights and other social issues; the other was responsible for watching the U.N.'s progress on reform and budget-cutting.  It is difficult to find a family-sized apartment in a good neighborhood for less than $2,000 a month, and many employees at the mission are earning less than $40,000 before taxes.  Top officials make about $60,000, and the ambassador's pay is $82,500, officials said.  Mr. Pickering has been spending several days a week in Washington negotiating with Congress in an attempt to win a new benefit package comparable to the compensation offered to FBI agents who move to New York.  In the largest conversion of campaign funds to personal use on record, former Rep. Gene Taylor drew a retirement bonus of $345,000 supplied largely by political-action committees and lobbyists.  Exploiting a loophole in federal law, the Missouri Republican in June quietly took most of a fund he had fattened for years with the help of special-interest money.  His campaign treasurer reported the transaction, as required, at the Federal Election Commission this week.  The episode illustrates how strongly members of Congress have come to view special-interest money as a perquisite of office.  "I don't think I did anything wrong," says Mr. Taylor, a former automobile dealer.  Even so, last month the Senate passed without dissent a bill that would outlaw such actions.  "Public office is a trusteeship," said Sen. Richard Shelby (D.,Ala.), the sponsor of the measure, "and is not a means to accrue personal wealth."  Mr. Taylor agrees, after a fashion.  "He's sure right there, because you can't get wealthy in public office."  At the end of 1987, according to the last disclosure report Mr. Taylor filed before leaving office, he was debt-free and had income-producing assets he valued at between $260,000 and $600,000, including 282 acres of Missouri farmland, plus half interest in another 260-acre farm and in a herd of 125 cattle.  He also qualifies for a pension of $33,622 a year, fully adjusted for future inflation.  Retired lawmakers are pocketing ever-larger sums, but the most previously was $83,696 last year by former Rep. William Carney (R., N.Y.), according to Congressional Quarterly.  Some even leave the money to their heirs; last year, the late Rep. John Duncan (R., Tenn.) willed more than $600,000 to his widow and children, and the estate of the late Rep. James Howard (D., N.J.) got $310,000 as well.  It's already illegal for lawmakers to convert campaign funds to personal use, but a "grandfather clause" in the law exempts every member who took office before Jan. 8, 1980.  A House rule bans personal use of campaign funds but doesn't cover retirees.  A broader Senate rule does cover former members but isn't enforceable; the Ethics Committee failed to punish former Sen. Harrison Williams (D., N.J.) when he cleared out $66,781 on his way to federal prison after his Abscam conviction.  At least $862,000 had been converted by last January, when CQ ran a tally.  That didn't count money left by deceased members, and exempt retirees including Mr. Taylor held $2 million more that could be converted, according to CQ.  But that's nothing: 191 current House members and 73 senators are grandfathered, and two of them, Reps.  Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) and Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) hold more than $1 million each.  Those golden parachutes leave some people sputtering.  "It is ludicrous that conversion is breaking the law for some members but perfectly OK for others," says Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause.  The practice rankles many donors, who complain that their funds are being misused.  "The money was given for his campaign," says Kenneth Cole, past president of the National Association of Business PACs, which supports repeal of the grandfather clause.  But it doesn't bother Thomas Nemet, a donor whose imported-car dealers' PAC gave $1,500 to Mr. Taylor's re-election committee nine months before he announced that he wouldn't run.  "I have no problem; absolutely not.  When he went into Congress, he gave up a very significant income as a dealer," says Mr. Nemet.  Neither does it trouble Mr. Taylor.  Chatting amiably, he says he has spent $50,000 of the money already for a Gene Taylor Library and Museum in his home town, Sarcoxie, Mo., a hamlet of about 1,400 people that claims to be the "Peony Capital of the World."  He says he'll make other charitable donations, pay taxes, and with what's left "I'll buy beer, grass seed and that kind of stuff."  ---  @ Rich Grandfathers  House members with the most leftover campaign funds who qualify under a "grandfather clause" allowing them to take the money for personal use upon retirement.  @Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.)* ..................... $1,158,484  @Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) .................... 1,015,580  @Ronnie Flippo (D., Ala.) ....................... 825,696  @Matthew Rinaldo (R., N.J.) ..................... 766,703  @Robert Matsui (D., Calif.) ..................... 763,501  @James Quillen (R., Tenn.)* ..................... 711,012  @Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) ....................... 639,516  @Bill Archer (R., Texas)* ....................... 629,908  @William Broomfield (R., Mich) .................. 625,212  @Carlos Moorhead (R., Calif.) ................... 616,181  @NOTE: Cash on hand 6/30/89, except as noted  @*Latest report 12/31/88  @Source: Federal Election Commission  Federal Aviation Administration Chairman James Busey will appoint a task force to study whether any redesign is needed to improve survivability when a wide-body airplane is damaged during flight.  Federal investigators attribute the July 19 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 jetliner in Sioux City, Iowa, to the rupture of the center engine's fan stage, which sent shrapnel into the plane's primary and two backup hydraulic systems.  The damage resulted in the loss of steering control, and 111 people died in the crash of the UAL Corp. unit's jet.  "Things like this are very rare, but we've got to do what we can to prevent them from disabling planes in the future," said an FAA spokesman.  The task force will consist of government and airline employees and aircraft makers.  They will examine planes that use hydraulic flight controls, which include wide-body aircraft.  Safety specialists have questioned the design of the McDonnell Douglas Corp. wide-body DC-10, which routes the thinly shielded hydraulic systems through the tail of the plane.  Members will study ways to improve backup control systems intended to ensure operation in a mishap.  The task force also will examine ways to prevent engine explosions from crippling an aircraft.  The FAA has a research and development program in which the feasibility of lining engines to contain exploding shrapnel is being studied, an official said.  Two other mid-air accidents, both involving wide-body planes, have resulted in the loss of pilot control, FAA officials said.  In August 1985, the rupture of a rear pressure wall caused a Japan Air Lines 747 made by Boeing Co. to lose hydraulic power over Japan, and the plane crash resulted in 520 deaths -- history's worst single-plane disaster.  In September 1981, the fan section of a Lockheed Corp. L-1011 engine broke, but the Eastern Airlines plane landed safely at New York's Kennedy Airport.  The incident preceded Eastern's acquisition by Texas Air Corp. Neither the DC-10 nor the L-1011 is produced anymore, but the planes are still widely used.  Insurance regulators in New Jersey found that high-risk motorists were overcharged $908 million during a five-year period because of insurance company errors.  The findings are the result of a 10-month investigation of 15 major insurers.  The state's insurance commissioner, Kenneth Merin, pledged to take quick action to recover the funds.  Among the companies reviewed, New Jersey regulators said they will demand the recovery of $153.3 million from Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of the giant retailer Sears, Roebuck & Co.; $113.1 million from Hanover Insurance Co., based in Worcester, Mass., and $100.2 million from Hartford, Conn.-based Travelers Corp.  The 15 insurers collect premiums and process claims for about 53% of the state's drivers, who are covered by New Jersey's Joint Underwriting Association.  The association, formed in 1983 to provide affordable insurance for high-risk drivers, was supposed to operate on a break-even basis.  Instead, it has amassed a deficit of about $3 billion.  Mr. Merin said he would seek immediate repayment of $72 million.  That amount includes $21.4 million owed to the state's auto insurance pool because of improper premium calculations and $50.7 million of installment fees that the insurers should have turned over to the pool.  The commissioner is still discussing with the state's attorney general ways to recover the remainder, which includes $428 million in overpaid claims.  In the 1984-88 period, the 15 carriers collected a total of $1.6 billion in servicing fees.  Under New Jersey law, the insurance commissioner can directly order the companies to repay excess fees or sue in court for repayment.  New Jersey regulators estimate $375 million was paid in excess servicing fees.  In addition to seeking to recover these funds, Mr. Merin said he wants to develop a set of performance standards for insurers doing business in New Jersey.  "It was our assumption that the insurance industry knew how to handle the business of insurance," he said.  "But these audits show their practices don't live up to reasonably prudent standards."  For New Jersey motorists, the investigation probably won't result in lower auto insurance rates.  Mr. Merin said he won't seek a rate rollback because the inefficiencies that were uncovered varied from company to company.  But he said the annual surcharge that all New Jersey drivers must pay to fund the association's coverage pool could be reduced as fees are recouped from the 15 insurers.  Travelers, Cigna Corp., Continental Corp. and several other carriers said they couldn't comment on all the criticisms raised by New Jersey regulators because they hadn't seen the entire report.  Travelers did acknowledge that New Jersey contends the company miscalculated premiums and undercharged the pool by $9.4 million.  A spokesman said the company has been working with the association to resolve this premium dispute.  Other reactions were mixed.  For example, Aetna Life & Casualty Co. in Hartford, Conn., noted that the report labels $13 million of the $43.8 million that New Jersey regulators seek to recover from the company as excess servicing fees.  An Aetna spokesman said he was surprised that servicing fees were an issue becasue these fees are approved by the insurance commissioner.  He said whenever these fees have been reduced, Aetna has accepted the lower amounts without complaint.  Neil Jasey, general counsel for Prudential Property & Casualty Co., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, said it is "difficult to be happy with this report because of what it says about the insurance industry."  But Prudential officials indicated they weren't too distressed, because their company received fairly favorable ratings in most of the areas reviewed.  Newmont Mining Corp. said it is dropping a plan to squeeze $500 million in cash out of its investment in Peabody Holding Co.  But Newmont said it hasn't given up on its goal of getting cash out of Peabody, North America's largest coal concern.  A spokesman said Newmont is studying other ways to pull out some of the value of its 49.97% stake in Peabody and use those funds to reduce Newmont's debt.  Newmont blamed the change in plans on troubles in the coal industry, including coal-miner strikes in June and early July that cost Peabody $5 million a day and raise questions about labor relations.  The company also cited concern about proposed acid-rain legislation that might affect coal prices.  Newmont said those events apparently raised too many questions about Peabody's future for Peabody to secure the approximately $1 billion in financing needed for the transaction.  Initially, Peabody was to borrow money to buy out holders of 50.03% of its stock for $575 million, leaving Newmont as the sole owner.  But Newmont said the coal industry's problems made the price to be paid to Peabody's other stockholders "potentially uneconomic."  Peabody also would have borrowed to pay Newmont a $425 million cash dividend.  The last part of the plan called for Newmont to sell 50% of its Peabody stake to Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. for $75 million.  Newmont still would retain a 50% stake and would also receive a total of $500 million in cash to reduce its $1.2 billion in debt.  Soybean futures tumbled to new life-of-contract lows in response to benign weather in U.S. farming regions and record supplies in South America.  The selloff reflected a continuing easing of tension over the temporary shortage of soybeans earlier this summer.  While soybeans from the bumper harvest in Brazil, the world's No. 2 producer after the U.S., have been slow in flowing into world markets this year because of the political and financial turmoil there, Brazilian exports have begun burying world prices.  Prices for August delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade have tumbled 10% in the past week as a result.  The unusually wide price premium of soybeans for August delivery compared with beans for delivery in November, after the U.S. harvest, has plunged by more than two-thirds.  The weather is likely to be nearly ideal for the U.S. soybean crop in the next couple of weeks, many meteorologists say, with moderate temperatures punctuated by showers across the Farm Belt.  "Everybody agrees with the weather forecast, and prices have a tendency to just slide," said Walter Spilka, analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York.  "The crops should continue to do real well, given that scenario."  U.S. farmers anticipating a big harvest have stepped up soybean sales as well.  The selloff in the bean pit dragged corn and wheat futures lower in thin trading, amid apprehension about a major government crop report set for release next week Thursday.  "It looks like a bottomless pit, which is probably an indication that one should cover shorts," or buy contracts to take profits on selling positions, said Katharina Zimmer, analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., New York.  A private crop estimate by an influential commodities concern, Sparks Commodities Inc. of Memphis, Tenn., could spur some buying in corn futures when the market opens today.  Sparks predicted a corn crop of 7.349 billion bushels, traders said.  A Sparks official declined to comment.  While that would be an increase of 49% from last year's drought-damaged harvest, it nevertheless falls short of the levels many traders believe are reflected in current futures prices.  "It's lower than traders are thinking," said Robert Lekberg, analyst with Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp., Chicago.  Current prices would reflect a harvest of about 7.7 billion to 7.8 billion bushels, some analysts estimated.  But Mr. Lekberg said the Sparks estimates "sound very fair to me," based upon the number of acres farmers planted last spring and upon the Aug. 1 timing of the Sparks survey, which was conducted before recent rains improved conditions.  Sparks also told clients it expects soybean production of 1.934 billion bushels, which would be a 26% increase from last year's level.  Separately, Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. dropped its lawsuit seeking to block the Chicago Board of Trade's emergency order forcing liquidation by traders in July soybean futures.  The exchange issued the order after Ferruzzi's accumulation of large holdings on cash and futures markets threatened to force prices sharply higher.  But the big Italian merchant and processor said it still plans to sue the Board of Trade for damages for losses incurred as a result of the July 11 order.  In other commodity markets yesterday:  ENERGY: Oil markets ignored reports of continued high OPEC production to focus on the political situation in Lebanon.  "A lot of people are trading on Middle East news," one trader said.  As a result, petroleum futures were relatively firm much of the day.  But then there was a late-day selloff on the New York Mercantile Exchange after an apparent easing of the tension in the hostage crisis.  After the report that a pro-Iranian Moslem group in Lebanon had "suspended" the threatened execution of a U.S. hostage, West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery, which had reached a high of $18.50 a barrel during the day, settled at $18.21, down eight cents.  The October crude contract was down 17 cents a barrel to settle at $17.91.  There was little market reaction, meanwhile, to the monthly report of the International Energy Agency, which estimated July crude-oil production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at 21.3 million barrels a day, the same rate as that estimated in June.  COPPER: The September futures contract gave up some of its recent gains, and prices for other months were narrowly mixed.  The September contract declined 0.45 cent a pound to $1.1265.  September copper has been running at a premium to the December contract -- on Wednesday it was four cents a pound higher -- which reflects an increasing tightness of supplies.  At the beginning of trading, warehouses of New York's Commodity Exchange held 18,894 tons of copper, down 1,025 tons from Wednesday.  But at the same time, one analyst said, the possibility of an end to the strike at Highland Valley Mines in British Columbia, a major Canadian copper producer, seemed to weigh on the September contract, narrowing its premium over December to 3.4 cents a pound.  The analyst said mediation has trimmed the number of issues outstanding in the Highland Valley negotiations to 10 from the 60 originally on the table.  Some of the remaining issues are "quite sticky," he said, and the dispute is far from settled, but "there is increased hope that it will be, in a reasonable amount of time."  The improved situation at Highland Valley follows reports on Wednesday from Papua New Guinea that another major producer, Bougainville, might resume operation by the end of this month or early September after being shut down since May 15.  PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended higher despite some late selling.  Gold for August delivery was up $3.60 an ounce at $373.70, while September silver gained seven cents an ounce to $5.333.  October platinum rose $3.40 to $506.50.  Continued tension over the hostage situation in the Middle East was the principal market-supporting influence, according to one analyst.  Precious-metals traders ignored a higher dollar, he said, creating an unusual situation in which a "flight to safety" was working, at the same time, for the dollar and for precious metals.  Demand for precious-metals contracts was triggered in the early afternoon by a report that U.S. warships were moving closer to Iran and a rumor that a second U.S. hostage in Lebanon had been killed, the analyst said.  Toward the end of the session, selling caused prices to ease from their highs.  Just about at the close, the analyst said, and too late for the market to react, there was news that the group holding the hostage had suspended its death threat.  Another analyst, Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber Inc., New York, said the hostage situation might ultimately have differing effects on gold and the dollar.  "The rise in gold has come solely from the tension in the Middle East, and when it abates, gold is likely to decline," he said.  "On the other hand, the strong stand against terrorism by President Bush might be constructive for the dollar because it would enhance its 'flight-to-safety' allure," he said.  Nearly two months after the Tiananmen Square massacre, there isn't any clear indication that a substantial amount of investment is moving to other Asian countries from China and Hong Kong.  Business executives and government officials around the region say they have been receiving inquiries about new investments and manufacturing orders since the June 4 killings in Beijing, but they say it's too early to tell if money that would have gone to China is coming their way.  For the moment, however, manufacturers operating in China, particularly in the south, say production and deliveries have returned to normal after slight disruptions in early June.  Given this quick recovery, few foreign businesses are considering walking away from their investments.  Many expansion plans and new investments are on hold, however, hurt by austerity measures Beijing imposed earlier, as well as by the political uncertainty.  More problematic are foreign buyers who place orders with China-based factories.  Hong Kong executives with operations in China say some buyers, particularly Americans, have canceled orders with China and shifted some of them to Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region.  But the executives say they believe the orders eventually will go back to China, assuming there is no further political upheaval or severe change in economic policy.  Whether the rest of the region ultimately benefits from uncertainty over China and Hong Kong's future also will depend in part on whether incentives are provided to attract capital and people.  With Hong Kong due to revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the killings spurred worries that accelerated emigration would undermine the colony's economy and its status as a financial center.  The confidence crisis has yet to fade in Hong Kong, and emigration seems certain to rise from already-troubling levels, but there doesn't appear to be an exodus of business under way or even a significant loss of interest by companies considering whether they should set up in the colony.  The major worry for Hong Kong businesses remains the "brain drain" of skilled workers and managers.  Emigration is expected to grow, averaging between 50,000 and 60,000 people annually during the next few years, from the estimated record 45,000 emigrants in 1988.  Here is a survey of the impact of the China turmoil on investments and immigration in the Asian-Pacific region:  Indonesia  With its large population and low labor costs, Indonesia is widely seen as an alternative for manufacturers anxious about operating in China.  Jakarta businessmen report a rise in foreign-investment inquiries since June 4, but it isn't clear if they will translate into investment or new orders for Indonesian manufacturers.  A foreign business consultant predicts that turmoil in China will result in only "a trickle" of additional investments.  Hong Kong garment makers say Indonesia received some orders shifted out of China, but they expect business will return to China if political conditions stabilize.  Foreign investors' interest in Indonesia has been rising during the past few years, partly as a result of state efforts to deregulate the economy.  Hong Kong investors already rank second in Indonesia, after Japan, on the Investment Coordinating Board's list of total foreign investments outside the country's huge oil industry.  Japan  A move away from China or Hong Kong seems unlikely for Japanese companies.  While those operating in China have clearly become more cautious since the Tiananmen shootings, it appears that investment projects and discussions are continuing.  Japanese employees are returning to their posts in China and the general feeling among businessmen is that no one with any significant commitment is likely to pull out now.  Japanese commitment to Hong Kong seems even more solid.  While there have been news reports in Singapore suggesting that some of Japan's leading securities firms might be considering moving operations there from Hong Kong, Tokyo officials deny this.  Like Indonesia, Japan isn't likely to alter its stiff immigration rules to allow large-scale entry of Hong Kong residents.  The Philippines  During the past year, the Philippines has attracted considerable interest from Hong Kong investors.  Hotels, resorts and garment-making ventures have been among the popular investments.  Whether there will be a boost in Hong Kong investments because of the Tiananmen massacre remains to be seen.  Similarly, the Philippines hasn't experienced a surge in manufacturing orders or investments that were planned for China.  Officials of the Board of Investments and business consultants say investment inquiries rose in early June but the interest seems to have waned.  Because the Philippines has economic and security worries of its own, its ability to capitalize on China's misfortune may well depend on offering further investment and immigration incentives.  A revision of the country's investment-visa program is under discussion.  Singapore  The country that has made the boldest attempt to attract money and people from Hong Kong may well be the biggest beneficiary to date of the fallout from the killings in Beijing.  Political jitters before June 4 had already sent Hong Kong money into Singapore shares and residential properties, analysts say, and the trend is expected to continue.  International fund managers fleeing the volatile colony market also are buying Singapore shares.  However, a large number of Hong Kong people could be moving to Singapore in the next few years, considering the initial reaction to a change in immigration rules and a new visa system that would let Singapore absorb as many as 100,000 Hong Kong people in eight years.  South Korea  The political crackdown in Beijing seems to have had little impact on the already cautious stance South Korean businessmen maintain toward trade and investment in China.  When the long-standing political freeze between the two countries began to thaw three years ago, Korean businesses rushed into China seeking export markets, new sources of raw materials and investment opportunities.  But the Koreans soon realized the depth of China's economic problems and saw that the country wasn't such a compatible business partner.  In the past few months, several Korean business groups have sent representatives back into China to assess the climate for trade and investment.  An executive of the giant Samsung Group says Koreans are undaunted by the political repression in China, having lived and thrived in a similar atmosphere for years in Korea.  As for potential Hong Kong immigrants, analysts say Seoul isn't likely to amend its strict regulations on granting residency.  Junk bonds, just like stocks, can be big winners or losers.  And to avoid getting caught in a selling stampede, high-yield investors must know how to distinguish the junk from the trash, analysts say.  Take a look at the junk market's best and worst performers in 1989's second quarter, as calculated by First Boston.  The four top performers racked up total returns -- price changes plus interest payments -- ranging from 13% to almost 17% for Fruehauf, Gulf States Utilities, Healthtrust and Continental Airlines.  But the junkiest issues devastated investors.  Bonds of Resorts International, Griffin Resorts, Tracor, Interco, AP Industries and Integrated Resources all showed losses of more than 37%.  "There's a big difference between junk and trash," says David Wyss of Data Resources, author of a recent junk-bond study.  Prices of all bonds move when interest rates change.  But junk bonds are the lowest debt securities on the totem pole, ranking only a bit higher than common stocks if a company is liquidated.  Because of this, junk moves up and down sharply when the company's fortunes change.  Behind every junk-bond winner, there's a good story.  Healthtrust's business prospects are improving after the shakeout in health care.  Speculators bet that Gulf States Utilities would surmount its regulatory problems and a big lawsuit over a nuclear plant.  Individual junk winners showed respectable gains even by stock-market standards.  Overall, the Standard & Poor's 500 shares gained less than 9% in the second quarter.  With trash bonds, it's always the same story, investors say: The companies have too much debt and their businesses aren't in great shape.  As investors rushed to dump trash in the second quarter, they depressed the whole junk market.  First Boston's High Yield Index showed a paltry second-quarter return of less than 4%.  But some risky securities in First Boston's index remained popular; leveraged buy-out bonds, issued by companies that go private, gained almost 5%.  Most studies to date show that junk outperforms high-quality bonds over the long haul.  But that wasn't true in the second quarter, by a long shot.  For example, 10year Treasury bonds showed total returns of 10%.  Lists of junk winners and losers seldom appear in the press.  When a Wall Street firm compiles such a list, it creates a furor, because traders at competing firms can't agree how to price individual issues.  In the secretive $200 billion junk market, bonds mostly trade over-the-counter at infrequent intervals, and many transactions aren't seen, except by the buyer and seller.  Often, junk prices "are in the eye of the beholder," says Michael McNelley of Caywood-Christian Capital Management in San Diego.  The money manager says published prices for junk winners and losers probably are "both slightly exaggerated."  Wall Street firms might try to make bonds underwritten by competitors look worse than they really are, he says.  In a few cases, different firms' price quotations are miles apart.  For instance, Caywood-Christian sought bids on Griffin Resorts bonds from two Wall Street firms on June 30, then priced the bonds in its portfolio at 73.5 cents on the dollar, down from the mid-90s three months earlier.  After the interest payment was added back, the bonds' loss was about 18% in the quarter.  But First Boston says it briefly saw Griffin trade at only 55 cents on the dollar on June 30, putting the bonds' loss for the quarter at 39%.  First Boston says its winners and losers all reflect real trading prices, although traders say Drexel Burnham Lambert, which underwrote the Griffin bonds, never bid below the low 70s for them.  Stocks, of course, generally are listed on public exchanges and they trade comparatively actively, at published prices that are visible to everybody.  The big money in junk often is made -- or lost -- by betting on a big event or an industry turnaround.  Among the second-quarter winners, Continental and its parent Texas Air soared as investors concluded Eastern Airlines might be on its way out of bankruptcy-law protection.  Of course, airline stocks also have done well this year.  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, after borrowing heavily to recapitalize, showed it wanted to cut debt when it put on the block its valuable Sea World theme parks.  Fruehauf agreed to sell its last operating unit to Canada's Varity to pay bondholders.  Now, there are rumors some Fruehauf holders may try to block the sale and get a higher price.  Health-care junk, in the doldrums last year because of turmoil at hospitals and bond defaults, led the pack in 1989's second quarter with an 8% gain for the group, First Boston calculates.  Some investors think potential survivors of the health-care shakeout, such as Hospital Corp. of America, may still be good buys.  "The investment lesson is that bonds that are out of favor can come back," says Mr. McNelley of Caywood-Christian Capital.  He's keen on some oil and gas bonds, too.  But investors don't seem ready yet to buy the least favored group, financial junk, which dived more than 13% in the quarter.  In this group are Southmark, which recently filed for bankruptcy-law protection, Integrated Resources, which is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy court, and Centrust Savings.  Cyclical financial and real estate businesses don't mix well with junk bonds, analysts say.  Tracor, with its unpredictable defense business, also shouldn't have issued junk, they add.  As for Griffin mortgage bonds, issued by Hollywood's Merv Griffin to buy the Resorts International casino company: Analysts say the showman overpaid, creating unmanageable debt-service costs.  Moreover, some say that if the casino had to be liquidated, there might be a fight over who gets the assets, Griffin or Resorts International bondholders.  ---  @ A Tally of Junk Bond Winners . . .  @ Ten best performers, second quarter, 1989  @ Second Twelve  @ Quarter Months  @ Coupon Returns To June 30  @ Continental Airlines Inc.  @ 11.375% 16.69% 35.03%  @ Healthtrust Inc.  @ 16.500 14.49 41.07  @ Gulf States Utilities Co.  @ 12.125 13.40 30.31  @ Freuhauf Corp.  @ 13.500 12.95 26.43  @ Gulf States Utilities Co.  @ 13.125 12.49 23.63  @ Hospital Corp. of America  @ 15.750 12.35 12.35  @ Duracell Holdings Corp.  @ 13.125 11.96 13.04  @ Texas Air Corp.  @ 14.250 11.89 25.56  @ Bethlehem Steel Corp.  @ 8.450 11.84 15.04  @ Harcourt Brace Jovanovich  @ 14.750 11.52 14.83  @ . . .

The stock market rally has a stronger base of support from long-term investors than previously thought, a new study says.  The report by the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, suggests that despite the recent growth of computer-driven program trading, these short-term traders haven't accounted for as much of the stock market rally as many investors think.  The association has been making efforts to separate "real" daily trading volume by investors from various professional trading strategies, such as stock-index arbitrage, dividend captures and other computer-guided program trades.  According to the association's new report, "Investor Activity -- Is It Finally There?", official trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange is up only about 4% this year from 1988's doldrums, to 169 million daily shares from 162 million.  But the report says that "real" volume is up 16% from 1988's "real" volume, to 148 million shares from 128 million.  "Increases in volume in the past have been overstated because a lot really involved short-term technical trading strategies," said Jeffrey M. Schaefer, the securities association's director of research.  But he says, "That's less of the case now."  On the surface, this appears to be good news for the stock market.  If investors, and not just short-term traders, are buying stocks, then there may be less danger that the current rally will suddenly turn into a rout.  So far this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 22%.  So why isn't this development great news?  Because it chips away at conventional wisdom that there are a host of big and medium-sized institutional investors "on the sidelines" still refusing to buy stocks.  Conventional wisdom holds that these investors can be counted on one day to flood back in and carry the market ever higher.  According to the report, many of these supposedly uninterested investors have already been playing the market the past few months.  Of course, there is still no sign that the legions of small, mom-and-pop investors have decided to return to the stock market, according to industry executives, traders and brokers.  The industry's "retail," or individual-investor, business has remained stagnant since the 1987 stock crash.  Small investors "are starting to show an interest in equities, but they're not banging away at it," said Mr. Schaefer.  The association said that during the first half of this year, retail trading volume was up 13% from last year's pace.  But such activity, "although starting to trickle back," still "is not coming back to the same extent as the institutional and member-firm categories," the association's report said.  Big Board volume remains dominated by big institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers.  In June, institutional investors bought a daily average of 3.1 million more shares than they sold -- far above the 1988 daily average net purchases of only 300,000 shares and even the 1.7 million daily average of pre-crash 1986.  Institutional interest also is strong in the over-the-counter market, which until recent years had been the domain of the small investor.  In May, institutions bought a record 4.7 million more shares daily than they sold, although that buying frenzy cooled to 1.9 million shares daily in June.  Congressional investigators said they have received information that suggests Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. filled capsules with SmithKline Beecham PLC's blood-pressure medicine to win government approval to sell a generic version of the drug.  The allegations against the Copiague, N.Y., company were made in a letter from the chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee investigating generic drug companies to Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.  The subcommittee said memos it obtained from an outside lab hired by Bolar to test the drug suggest Bolar substituted SmithKline's product to obtain approval to sell the drug in 1987.  However, Bolar President Robert Shulman denied that the company passed off the brand-name drug as its own in bioequivalance testing.  Such testing determines whether the drug is absorbed into the body at the same levels as the pioneer product.  "Emphatically, categorically I can say that we didn't use the SmithKline product," Mr. Shulman asserted.  If the allegations prove true, Bolar would become the second generic drug maker to have tricked the FDA to get approval to sell copies of Dyazide.  In June, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., admitted to the FDA that it submitted Dyazide in Vitarine capsules to gain FDA approval.  Vitarine was the subject of a front-page story in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.  Bolar was the first out with a generic Dyazide, and Vitarine was close behind.  Bolar said its version of Dyazide, the blood-pressure medicine, is being analyzed by the Food and Drug Administration.  "Bolar is confident that when the FDA's tests are completed, its product will be fully vindicated," the company said.  The follow-up tests were ordered after the subcommittee put pressure on the FDA. Mr. Shulman said Bolar's version of Dyazide is safe and effective and that has been proven through clinical testing.  "I insist there is absolutely nothing wrong," he said.  The news sent Bolar's stock plunging $1.25 a share to $27.75 before trading was halted on the American Stock Exchange yesterday morning.  When Bolar received approval to market its Dyazide copy in 1987 the company's stock shot up more than $6 a share in one day.  Bolar and Vitarine were the only two companies to gain generic approval for copies of Dyazide, a competition that significantly hurt SmithKline.  Subcommittee Chairman John D. Dingell (D., Mich.) said Bolar's drug should be recalled unless the FDA had proof from recent inspections at Bolar that the company hadn't switched the SmithKline product for its own.  Officials at the FDA couldn't immediately be reached for comment.  Hemant Shah, a generic drug industry analyst in Warren, N.J., estimated that Bolar has between 40% and 50% of the $80 million generic market for the blood-pressure drug.  Mr. Shah said if Bolar were involved in a switch, recall costs would amount to about $15 million to $20 million.  In addition, he said, Bolar probably also would face litigation from SmithKline, which pioneered Dyazide more than 20 years ago.  At its peak, Dyazide was a $350 million-a-year drug for SmithKline.  As a result of generic competition, Mr. Shah estimates that SmithKline's Dyazide sales fell to about $200 million in 1988 and will be about $125 million this year.  He estimates that dwindling Dyazide sales cost SmithKline about $90 million in profit in 1988.  Officials at PharmaKinetics Laboratories Inc., which did bioequivalence testing for Bolar, noted on June 23 that the powder inside a Bolar test capsule of its version of Dyazide was darker than powder contained in later batches.  "We detected what appeared to be an irregularity," said Paul L. Perito, an attorney for the contract laboratory.  He said that information was provided to Bolar, which promised to look into the reason for the color change.  Mr. Perito stressed that PharmaKinetics doesn't have any information, beyond the color discrepancy, that would show Bolar was involved in a switch.  Bolar's Mr. Shulman said he couldn't offer an explanation for the discrepancy in colors.  "The FDA will look at it and determine whether the color is important," he said.  In an earlier statement, PharmaKinetics said that "no one connected in any way with PharmaKinetics had knowledge whatsoever of the alleged switch of drug substances.  PharmaKinetics cannot have been expected to spot the switch in the testing which it did."  Texas American Bancshares Inc. said it filed for Chapter 11 protection under the federal Bankruptcy Code.  The filing was expected.  Two weeks ago, the banking concern lost its bank subsidiaries when regulators seized and sold them.  In its filing, Texas American listed assets of about $55 million, including a data-processing unit, and liabilities of about $109 million.  Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a reorganization plan.  President Bush has some idea who is holding the American hostages in Beirut, but that doesn't mean he has the quality of intelligence he needs to act.  One of the likely captors is Imad Mugniyah, who is said to wear three guns at all times: one on each side and one on his back.  Another is Hussein Musawi, a school teacher turned terrorist.  The president also knows which neighborhoods, and even which buildings, have been used to imprison the hostages at various times.  Even now, Joseph Cicippio and the remaining American hostages are believed to be held in Chiyah, Borj El Brajne or another of the cinderblock slums of south Beirut.  But Mr. Bush has been unable to act because the U.S. has no way of pinpointing the hostages' locations at any moment.  As a result, the U.S. has been paralyzed by perhaps 500 hard-core fanatics wedged into a few sectors of a country smaller than Connecticut.  "Nobody can look the President in the eye and say, 'I guarantee you if you move within the next X hours or days, they're there and there's a 90% chance of success,'" says Richard Murphy, who was President Reagan's assistant secretary of State for the Middle East.  "It isn't that kind of situation."  U.S. intelligence forces' embarrassing inability to penetrate the terrorists' world is due largely to the nature of Lebanon's Shiite Moslems, who comprise the most aggressive of that war-torn country's sects.  The religious warriors holding the hostages operate in a network of family alliances that nurture and protect them.  They live in a rabbit warren of flat-roofed concrete buildings, where outsiders are quickly identified and confronted.  No local government dares intrude.  Their willingness to die for their cause is evident in the 1989 "Martyr of the Month" calendar, featuring pictures of fallen zealots.  They are members of the Shiite sect of Islam and of its militant Lebanese organization, the Party of God, or Hezbollah.  Galvanized by generations of poverty and discrimination in their own country, they have taken their inspiration from Iran's late Ayatollah Khomeini, who was the world leader of the Shiites.  They hate the Israelis who invaded their southern Lebanese villages in 1982 -- and Israel's patron, the United States, which sent Marines into their domain until Shiite terrorists slaughtered 241 of them by driving a bomb into their barracks.  The importance of bloodlines is visible in the intensely personal aspects of the terror.  Some of the Hezbollah captors -- including those who have kidnapped Americans -- are seeking to have their own relatives freed from captivity in Kuwaiti, Israeli and German jails.  Mr. Mugniyah, for instance, has a brother-in-law jailed in Kuwait after his conviction for bombing the U.S. and French embassies there in 1983.  Mr. Mugniyah wants the U.S. to pressure Kuwait into releasing his brother-in-law.  Mr. Mugniyah's wife works at his side wearing a dark Islamic veil.  Another Hezbollah clan holding hostages, the Hamadis, is pressuring West Germany for the release of one of its members, Mohamed Hamadi, who was convicted for his role in the 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847, in which an American sailor was murdered.  But even these details are sketchy, so poor is U.S. knowledge about Hezbollah.  There is always a chance, of course, that the Central Intelligence Agency knows more than it is letting on.  And it's possible that Israel's kidnapping of a local Hezbollah leader, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, could yield an intelligence bonanza sufficient to break the hostage case.  But U.S. officials, right up through Mr. Bush, insist they lack hard intelligence data on the hostages.  From space, the U.S. can photograph a street intersection in south Beirut and it routinely intercepts telecommunications.  But to no avail.  "There is no substitute to people who are on the ground," says Sen. Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee.  The situation on the ground is one of anarchy.  Lebanon may be the least-governed patch of the planet.  There is no civil government or police force worthy of the name that could help the U.S.  The country is divided into sections controlled by Syria, allies of Israel, Christian warlords, Sunni Moslems, Druze, and at least two groups of Shiites, including Hezbollah.  "In the south of Beirut, there is no control at all.  You have one law there, and it's the law of Hezbollah," says a leading French expert on terrorism who writes under the pen name of Xavier Raufer.  There is already much American blood on the hands of Hezbollah.  It planned the bombing of the Marine barracks near Beirut in 1983, slaughtering 241 Marines who were on a peacekeeping mission.  One of Hezbollah's leaders, Sheik Abbas Musawi -- who himself is believed to be a relative of one of the hostage-takers -- yesterday bragged about the Marine massacre, publicly taunting Mr. Bush about it.  The group has twice bombed U.S. embassy buildings in Beirut, killing a total of 72 people, including the CIA's top Middle East expert, Robert Ames, and several of his deputies.  During two airline hijackings, in 1984 and 1985, Hezbollah members singled out American passengers and killed them.  The murder toll also includes hostage William Buckley, who was the CIA station chief in Beirut; Malcolm Kerr, the president of the American University there, and now, presumably, Col. William Higgins, who headed a U.N. peacekeeping force.  To the extent they know much of anything, U.S. intelligence experts suspect that such Hezbollah groups as "Oppressed of the Earth," which claimed to kill Col. Higgins, and "Revolutionary Justice," which is threatening Mr. Cicippio, aren't really separate groups at all.  Instead, those and other fearsome-sounding names, experts think, could be cover names for carrying out actions approved by Hezbollah's ruling council.  Even if the CIA could send a Lebanese-American agent into Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, experts say he wouldn't get far.  "I wouldn't say it's difficult to infiltrate.  I'd say it's impossible," says Mr. Raufer, the French consultant.  "You'd have to be not only an Arab, not only Lebanese, but able to show you came from some particular family in some particular village in southern Lebanon."  And if not?  "You'd end up like William Buckley," Mr. Raufer says.  The U.S. also lacks reliable local allies who might help.  American intelligence was well-wired among Lebanon's Christians and Palestinians, but the Christians have no entree into Hezbollah areas and Palestinian leaders have been driven out of Lebanon by Israel.  Another problem is that Hezbollah is compartmentalized into small terrorist cells that move among multiple bases and that cooperate with each other.  Former French hostages report that a French book taken from one of them later was given to a second who had supposedly been captured by an entirely different group.  Some other former hostages report being moved -- sometimes in car trunks, wrapped like mummies -- from one building to another.  "These people aren't arrayed like conventional forces.  They scatter like sand crabs," says Noel Koch, the Pentagon's former chief counter-terrorism official.  Hezbollah terrorists occupy, in addition to their south Beirut stronghold, several buildings in the town of Baalbek.  The third home base for Hezbollah-affiliated families is in south Lebanon, where Shiite villages are clustered, and where Col. Higgins was seized.  These sites, including the Sheik Abdullah Barracks in Baalbek, have been photographed from the air by the Pentagon.  Plans were drawn years ago for bombing them.  But a French bombing raid in 1983 had little effect, and it's doubtful that the terrorists are staying there in large numbers during the current crisis.  Even if the U.S. could play on the Hezbollah's turf, it wouldn't be comfortable with the eye-for-an-eye rules.  In 1985, for instance, after four Soviet diplomats in Lebanon were kidnapped and one killed, Moscow got the Druze to snatch some of the kidnappers' relatives.  The Soviet hostages were freed after a body part from one of the relatives was mailed to the terrorists.  But the State Department the same year vetoed a CIA plan to kidnap Mr. Mugniyah while he was traveling in Paris.  The State Department nixed the action to avoid offending France, according to an account in "Best Laid Plans," a book about the failed war on terrorism.  Wendy's International Inc., hurt by discounting and price promotions, posted flat second-quarter net income.  The Dublin, Ohio, restaurant chain's profit for the quarter ended July 2 mirrored the year earlier's $9.6 million, or 10 cents a share.  The latest year's profit included $255,000 from the early extinguishment of debt.  Revenue was up slightly to $279.9 million from $275.1 million.  Wendy's said price promotions increased traffic, but cut profit margins.  In the first half, profit before an unusual item and an accounting change declined 22% to $10.2 million, or 11 cents a share, from $13.1 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier.  A gain of $5.2 million from the cumulative effect of an accounting change and a one-time gain of $594,000 from early retirement of debt made net $16 million, or 17 cents a share.  Revenue rose 2% to $539.4 million from $528.8 million.  WHO'S NEWS: International Creative Management, a Los Angeles and New York talent agency, named Guy McElwaine a vice chairman.  Mr. McElwaine, most recently chairman of the motion picture division of Weintraub Entertainment Group, was chairman and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures from 1983 to 1986.  Corporations flocked to the debt market again yesterday, offering $1.6 billion of new notes and bonds and pushing the total amount of new corporate issues for the past three days to more than $4 billion.  "Corporations, like investors, often operate with a herd instinct," said Robert Schwartz, a senior financial economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.  "The primary reason for the flurry of new issues is attractive rates," he added.  The large volume of new debt is also a sign that corporate treasurers are betting that rates may not fall much further.  Many are rushing to lock in low borrowing costs now, rather than risk seeing interest rates rise again.  For example, yields on long-term Treasury bonds fell below 8% last week for the first time in more than two years.  "That was a very important threshold level," says James Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch.  "We knew that once the bond moved below the 8% level there would be a substantial amount of new-issue activity."  Corporate bond traders say there was strong demand for the new debt issues, many of which sold briskly.  One trader said yesterday's offerings "were aggressively priced to move out quickly."  The best-selling securities were those structured to meet specific investor demand, particularly concerns about event-risk.  Penn Central Corp., for example, came to market with a $200 million 10-year subordinated debenture issue priced to yield 9 3/4%.  The issue contained covenants that provide bondholder protection in case of credit-damaging events such as a takeover, leveraged buy-out or restructuring.  The issue, underwritten by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., was sold out soon after pricing.  By the end of the day, all of the issues priced in the past several days had been freed to trade.  Other popular issues included Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s $300 million of noncallable 30-year senior notes priced to yield 9.343%.  The issue, which was increased in size from $250 million due to strong demand, gives investors the option to sell the notes back to the company in the 15th year.  Also in the market was Procter & Gamble Co., which issued $150 million of 20-year senior notes priced to yield 8.55%.  In the Treasury market, prices of long-term bonds fell sharply in heavy trading.  Bond traders attributed the declines to several technical factors, including the government's immense borrowing needs at next week's quarterly refunding.  They also cited concern over how the savings and loan bailout plan will be financed.  Prices of 30-year Treasury bonds fell 7/8 point, or about $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.  The yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.91% from 7.84% Wednesday.  Nevertheless, traders and money managers expect bond prices to bounce back once the Treasury refunding is completed.  "I don't consider this a major setback.  This is a case of indigestion as the market takes on more supply," said Joel Kazis, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.  "The general mood in the market is still very positive."  The Treasury is scheduled to sell $29.5 billion of new notes and bonds next week to raise about $13.6 billion in cash.  The credit markets are often depressed prior to such massive auctions, because some investors worry that the supply will overwhelm demand.  The Treasury said the auction will take place only if Congress increases the $2.8 trillion federal debt ceiling.  That contingency has limited the amount of preliminary "when-issued" trading, which has hurt bonds more than usual.  "The value of pre-trading is that it allows investors and dealers to gauge the demand for the new issues," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.  "Because of the uncertanties, there is some bidding back of prices to ensure that the upcoming supply can be adequately absorbed."  Treasury prices also reacted negatively to news that President Bush may veto Congress's "on budget" savings and loan bailout plan in favor of his own "off budget" plan.  If the proposed financing plan is off budget, the government may have to quickly issue large amounts of new 30-year bonds, Mr. Kahan said.  But if the new debt is put on budget, as Congress proposed, the Treasury would be able to sell debt slowly and across a wider maturity spectrum, lessening the impact on long-term bonds.  Today, the government will release its employment report for July.  Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets expect, on average, a 158,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls in July compared with a 180,000 increase in June.  Treasury Securities  The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted at a price of 111 29/32 to yield 7.83% compared with a price of 110 27/32 and yield of 7.91% Monday.  The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 109 7/32 to yield 7.75% compared with 108 29/32 to yield 7.975% Monday.  Among short-term rates, the discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted late at 7.69% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.93%.  The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.36% for a yield of 7.73%.  Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.  Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.  The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.  @ 45 Cash Management Bills  @ Applications $23,855,000,000  @ Accepted bids $5,002,060,000  @ Accepted at low price 22%  @ Average price (Rate) 99.003 (7.98%)  @ High price (Rate) 99.006 (7.95%)  @ Low price (Rate) 99.000 (8.00%)  @ Coupon equivalent 8.17%  @ The bills are dated Aug. 7 and mature Sept. 21.  Municipal Issues  Prices of tax exempts generally were unchanged to 1/4 point weaker.  New York City dominated the new-issue market with an offering of $950 million of revenue anticipation notes and $300 million tax anticipation notes.  The bulk of the notes were formally reoffered by underwriters to yield 5.60%, in line with market expectations.  In comparison, $3 billion of California notes were priced on Tuesday to yield 5.65%.  They were quoted in the secondary market yesterday to yield 5.69%.  Elsewhere in the secondary market, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due in 2018 were off 1/8 at 99 1/8, boosting their yield to 7.26%.  Mortgage-Backed Issues  Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities showed losses of up to 3/8 point in late dealings.  Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for August delivery was quoted at 98 30/32, off 11/32 on the day, to yield about 9.269% to a 12-year average life assumption.  Ginnie Mae's 8 1/2% securities were quoted at 96 26/32, off 11/32, while the 9 1/2% Ginnie Maes were at 100 24/32, down 9/32 on the day.  Fannie Mae's 9% issue was at 98 1/2, down 6/32, with Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% issue at 99 25/32, down 7/32.  Thrift selling continued apace during the session, but traders say solid demand for collateralized mortgage obligations has helped keep a floor under prices.  Foreign Bonds  British government bonds ended lower amid persistent weakness in the pound.  The Treasury's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 13/32 to 115 3/32 to yield 9.72%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 fell 3/32 to 99 7/8 to yield 11.80%.  Japanese government bond prices closed weaker in light activity.  The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 closed at a price of 97.12, down 0.30 yen per 100 yen face value.  The yield was 5.07%.  In West Germany, the Treasury's 7% issue due 1999 ended at 102.60 to yield 6.62%, down 0.20 point from late Wednesday.  The 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell 0.175 point at 100.30 to yield 6.63%.  Corporate Issues  In secondary trading, corporate issues closed 3/8 to 1/2 point lower on the day.  Traders say activity was concentrated on the new issues that came to market.  Hartford Insurance Group said net income fell 53% in the second quarter because of to higher-than-expected disaster losses, increased price competition and a $27.5 million write-down of its investment in brokerage firm Thomson McKinnon Inc.  The Hartford, Conn., insurance company's profit was $46.9 million, compared with $100.7 million a year earlier.  Hartford Insurance is a subsidiary of ITT Corp., New York.  Last week ITT said Hartford's profit declined substantially but didn't provide a figure.  Donald R. Frahm, chairman and chief executive officer, said that, excluding Thomson McKinnon, "our earnings are generally down but not inconsistent with this point in the underwriting cycle."  Earnings from North American property-casualty operations fell 43% to $45.7 million, while net investment income before taxes rose 7% to $161.8 million.  Profit from international property-casualty operations rose 30% to $16.8 million, while earnings from world-wide life insurance operations rose 43% to $11.9 million.  Walt Disney Co.'s stock price has taken off like Tinker Bell, soaring $11.25 a share during the past two days, and analysts say the pixie dust is made of part fundamentals and part takeover talk.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Disney shares closed up $6.375 each at $121, on heavy volume of nearly 1.9 million shares.  Analysts agreed that a recent flurry of takeover talk swirling around Disney is fueling the rise in part, although they don't believe a takeover is in the cards.  "It's not impossible, but it's improbable," said Harold Vogel, entertainment analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in New York.  He said one recent rumor that Paramount Communications Inc. might pursue Disney after dropping its hostile bid for Time Inc. is "most ridiculous" because Paramount "doesn't have the capital."  Mr. Vogel said a more likely scenario would be a leveraged buy-out, but even that isn't realistic now.  There is also some talk that Disney might split the stock.  Disney has declined all comment on the speculation.  Alan Kassan, entertainment analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said the market action is a "kind of delayed reaction" to several recent positive developments for Disney, of Burbank, Calif.  Earlier this week, Disney said it planned to double the size of its new Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park in Orlando, Fla., within the next three years because the attraction is such a hot item it can't accommodate the crowds.  "That drove home the point that what you had wasn't a problem with demand, but a problem in meeting demand," Mr. Kassan said.  "Here you have a $1 billion asset, and that's worth $7-plus per share."  Disney also disclosed this week that it has tentative plans for a new "sea-oriented" theme park in Long Beach, Calif.  Disney's filmed-entertainment business has been turning in strong results, in part because of the better-than-expected performance of its summer releases.  Mr. Kassan said he expects Disney's filmed-entertainment profit to increase to $266 million this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, from $186 million last year.  For fiscal 1990, he estimates filmed-entertainment profit will be around $360 million.  Christopher Dixon, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., said he thinks investors are reacting to new information that has begun circulating from European underwriters about Disney's proposed securities offering for its Euro Disneyland, which is set to open near Paris in 1992.  "Fees to Disney from Euro Disneyland will be much larger than the initial expectations," Mr. Dixon said.  He estimates the stock price will climb to $135 a share by the end of December and $165 a year from now.  Another reason traders cited for the stock jump is a column scheduled to appear in today's edition of USA Today by Dan Dorfman.  The story was promoted in yesterday's edition with a "teaser" headline that read "Friday -- Dan Dorfman: Is Disney Co.  For Real?"  At least one analyst is a skeptic.  Roy W. Hong of First Boston took Disney off his recommended list late last month.  "It's looking a little pricey," he said.  Apple Computer Inc. said it won its first award as a federal government contractor, signing an agreement to supply Macintosh IIx systems to the U.S. Postal Service.  The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker said the contract, including peripherals and service contracts, is worth potentially $30.2 million over a five-year period.  The Macintoshes will be used by the Postal Service for various applications, including information processing.  "This is a major milestone for our Federal Systems Group," said Bill Coldrick, senior vice president of sales, Apple USA.  He said the contract "further solidifies" the role of Apple and Macintosh in the government's information technology strategy.  Apple's Federal Systems Group, based in Reston, Va., has nine locations in the U.S.  Apple landed the contract in conjunction with Falcon Microsystems, Landover, Md., an authorized Apple federal government reseller.  Magazine entrepreneur Dale W. Lang agreed in principle to become a joint owner of the company that publishes Ms. and Sassy magazines, it was announced.  Executives at Matilda Publications Inc. have been looking for an infusion of capital for the publishing concern for several months.  Mr. Lang agreed to invest an undisclosed amount of money to assume joint ownership of Matilda Publications with Citicorp's Venture Capital Fund, which arranged financing for a management-led buy-out of the magazines last summer.  As part of the deal, Mr. Lang said in a statement he would take over management of both magazines, possibly as early as the October issues.  Ms., which was founded by the feminist Gloria Steinem and others in 1972, has a circulation of 550,000, Mr. Lang said.  Sassy, launched in March 1988, is a magazine for teen-age girls and has a circulation of 450,000.  In their last set of earnings before being privatized, the 12 electricity boards of England reported a 46% rise in pretax profit for the fiscal year.  The boards, which will become investor-owned companies in the $7 billion ($11.52 billion) privatization of the electricity industry in 1990, said they looked forward to the "new freedom" in the private sector.  In the year ended June 30, the boards made pretax profit of #424.2 million ($698.2 million), compared with #290.3 million in the previous year.  Calumet Industries Inc. said its board is seeking a buyer for the company and has hired an investment banking firm to help find a purchaser.  The Chicago refiner of specialty petroleum products said management has been trying to get long-term financing to replace short-term debt held by banks and insurance companies.  Calumet said its efforts have been unsuccessful, and as high oil prices keep hurting earnings, it concluded it's "highly unlikely" that long-term financing can be arranged soon.  Calumet said Chicago Corp., an investment banking firm, expects to begin to solicit offers within two months.  If an acceptable offer is obtained within four months, the company said it expects a transaction could be completed by Jan. 31.  The company said if a source of long-term financing is found, the board could decide not to sell the company.  In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Calumet closed at $7.50, up 25 cents.  Based on the company's 3.1 million common shares outstanding, Calumet has an indicated value of about $23.3 million.  Care Enterprises Inc., a Tustin, Calif., nursing home company that has been operating under bankruptcy-law protection for 17 months, said it agreed in principle with its creditors on a reorganization plan.  Creditors holding about $75 million face amount of unsecured debt would receive 85% of Care's equity; the rest would be retained by existing shareholders.  Care said its secured creditors, who are owed about $40 million, would be repaid under "terms and conditions to be decided prior to plan confirmation."  Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it forms a plan to pay its debts.  As part of the pact, Robert Baldwin Jr., chief operating officer, was named interim chief executive officer, succeeding Lee Bangerter, who remains chairman.  Dee Bangerter stepped down as chief financial officer, Care said.  The Bangerters, twin brothers who helped found Care with their mother, remain directors.  Mr. Baldwin said he expects the plan to be presented to the Los Angeles bankruptcy court at a Sept. 15 hearing.  Simon & Schuster Inc. signed a three-book contract with financial writer Charles J. Givens, author of the bestseller "Wealth Without Risk."  The publisher, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc., wouldn't disclose terms of the agreement, but Mr. Givens's representatives said he will receive more than $3 million.  The first book under the contract is titled "Ripoffs, Schemes and Scams: A Survivor's Guide For Winning with Money" and is scheduled to be published next spring.  While a number of financial authors have garnered big advances in recent years, Mr. Givens's advance is among the largest for any writer.  "Wealth Without Risk" has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 28 weeks and is currently No. 2 in the advice and how-to category.  The book is a compilation of Mr. Givens's tax, investment and personal finance strategies that he has taught to the clients of his financial planning organization for the past 15 years.  Soft-drink prices are beginning to turn around after several years of deep slashing, suggesting that the bloodletting in the cola wars may be ebbing on that front.  PepsiCo Inc.'s bottlers say retail prices for their products increased 2% in early summer.  And Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the giant Coca-Cola Co. bottler, said second-quarter retail prices were flat from a year-earlier, halting a downward spiral that began in early 1988.  Coca-Cola Enterprises has said it is cautiously optimistic that prices for the remainder of this year will rise above last year's level.  The increases may not seem so startling.  Some supermarkets that priced two-liter bottles of Coke and Pepsi at 99 cents now charge $1.09.  And price-slashing is as vicious as ever in some markets.  Over the Fourth of July weekend in Los Angeles, for example, one grocery chain sold six-packs of Coke and Pepsi for as little as 29 cents with coupons.  But the slight improvement in prices may signal what analysts and industry players have long been waiting for: an end to the price wars of the past several years.  That conflict has been squeezing the profit margins of Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottlers and badly wounding bottlers of smaller brands.  "It's everybody's dream to break out of the deep discounting," says Michael Weinstein, executive vice president at A&W Brands Inc.  "But market-share bragging rights are very important in this industry."  Pursuit of those bragging rights has left the $40 billion soft-drink industry in an unenviable pricing position.  While the Coke-Pepsi wars kept prices about flat between 1987 and 1988, the price of milk rose more than 2%, beer and ground beef more than 3%, and cereal more than 7%, according to the U.S. consumer price index.  As of May, Coke had a 32.4% food-store market share and Pepsi had a 28.9% share, according to Beverage Digest.  Despite the intensity of the price war in the past 1 1/2 years, those numbers have barely budged.  "The real value has been for consumers," says a former Coke bottler.  "With all the deals, people have been paying some prices that existed 15 years ago."  Prices charged by major bottlers, however, fell last year.  In recent years, bottlers have financed their price-slashing by consolidating operations, trimming overhead and improving productivity.  Ingredient costs were relatively low.  As a result, some 60% to 70% of the soda in grocery stores in the past few years has been on sale, according to industry estimates.  Bottlers now face new pressures to raise prices.  Costs, particularly of packaging and corn sweeteners, are rising.  That has worsened the pressure on Coca-Cola Enterprises, whose profit record has generally disappointed Wall Street since it went public three years ago.  Also, recent bottling-operation purchases by Pepsi lead some industry executives to believe the company will push for more price increases because the bottling business has become a bigger contributor to its bottom line. (Pepsi refuses to discuss its pricing strategy.)  Some analysts don't believe the higher prices will have any long-term effect on consumers' buying habits, especially for an outlay as small as the one on soda.  "People love their soft drinks; they'll make the adjustment," says Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst.  But the rising prices do appear to have affected the volume of soft drinks being produced, at least temporarily.  Volume increases in the second quarter slowed to a 3% growth rate from the 4% to 5% rate of the past several years.  Part of that may be attributable to this year's rainier summer and last year's extremely hot, dry weather.  But many industry observers say it may also reflect a decline in impulse buying.  Consumers have become accustomed to paying a certain price for soda on sale in end-of-aisle displays.  They may be waiting for the next sale.  And a rise in prices is one factor leading some industry experts to trim their projections for future volume growth.  In the next five years, soft-drink volume will grow about 3.1% on average, predicts Beverage Marketing Corp., a New York consulting company.  That rate compares to the go-go growth days of the 1960s which had 8% jumps in volume, and the 1970s and 1980s, when volume increases were anywhere from 4.5% to 8%.  Up to this point, "the industry really grew fast because there was so much price competition," says Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing.  Also factored into his new projections are increased competition from bottled water and fruit beverages, and an older population.  Supermarkets are concerned about the effects of higher soda prices.  Soft-drink promotions are a big draw for many chains, and Coke and Pepsi products alone account for an average 2% to 2.5% of a supermarket's total sales, according to George Thompson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.  Because the soft-drink bottler actually stocks the supermarket's shelves, store operators save on labor costs and generate very lucrative margins on soda sales.  "Of course we're concerned about the higher prices," said Robert Wunderle, a spokesman for Supermarkets General Corp. "But, realistically, we knew the promotional binge couldn't last forever."  Even with higher prices, discounting and holiday promotions aren't expected to disappear anytime soon.  "Coke and Pepsi use these strategies to steal business away from each other," says Roy Burry, a Kidder Peabody Inc. analyst.  "After all, these guys don't particularly like each other."  Deltona Corp. said its board rejected a $5.75-a-share cash merger proposal from Sycamore Acquisitions.  Deltona, a Miami real estate developer, called the proposal inadequate and too conditional, among other things.  Based on about 5.6 million common and common equivalent shares outstanding, the proposal has an indicated value of about $32.2 million.  Sycamore Acquisitions is a private company whose principal is Richard Fanslow, a Chicago-area investor, said a Deltona spokeswoman.  Mr. Fanslow couldn't be reached.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Deltona rose 12.5 cents a share, to close at $4.625.  On Wednesday, the proposal was submitted to a special board committee, formed earlier this year to consider Deltona's business plans and strategies.  The House approved a $27 billion transportation bill increasing Federal Aviation Administration appropriations by 17.5% in fiscal 1990 and imposing a permanent smoking ban on commercial airline flights of two hours or less.  The 366-50 roll-call vote last night followed earlier passage of a smaller but politically significant spending measure rolling back congressional restrictions on abortion in this capital city.  More important than any policy change, the abortion debate demonstrated a new aggressiveness by those advocating a wider choice for women, and at least 16 lawmakers reversed their votes from a year ago.  The House action came as the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an $18.4 billion Treasury spending bill, and voted separately to slash funding for congressional mail and force lawmakers to account for their use of the free-mail, or franking privilege.  The $27 billion allocated to transportation programs under the House bill includes $11.9 billion in new budget authority for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and another $15.3 billion that would come from existing highway and airport trust funds.  The measure is marginally more than the April budget as a result of $64 million added to Coast Guard funding yesterday, and the chamber overwhelmingly rejected an amendment to eliminate $615 million for Amtrak.  Airport grants from trust funds would rise to $1.5 billion, a $100 million increase intended, in part, to accommodate large projects such as Denver's proposed facility.  The FAA's growth is driven by a 25% increase in facilities and equipment and this $1.73 billion account is slated to increase further next year under the agency's budget.  The anti-smoking provision would make permanent a temporary ban scheduled to expire in April.  The House Appropriations leadership successfully sidestepped a second airline provision seeking to block the sale of foreign routes by financially troubled U.S. airlines.  The measure appeared to be targeted primarily at Eastern Airlines, but Pan Am Corp. stood to be affected as well, and the committee used a procedural motion to prevent consideration of the legislation.  The Treasury measure in the Senate carries riders of its own, including two business-related provisions directed at the Internal Revenue Service and Postal Service.  Funds are denied for IRS enforcement of new tax laws governing employee-benefit plans, and the bill restricts the practice of major credit-card companies selling their services in partnership with nonprofit organizations.  Universities, public-television stations and veterans groups have been used in such marketing schemes, which have yielded huge quantities of third-class mail and are estimated to absorb as much as $30 million from annually appropriated postal subsidies.  From roads to border stations, the rush of spending legislation before the August recess is laced with favored items for both Congress and the executive branch alike.  The Treasury spending bill includes $200,000 to make improvements in Vice President Quayle's official residence, and while other agencies are being asked to absorb pay increases, the Office of Management and Budget is given another $722,000 to help it escape making personnel cuts.  Few items are more sensitive than congressional mail, and the Senate committee voted yesterday to hold next year's budget to $80 million -- a nearly 36% reduction from the House -- passed level.  Separate accounts would be set up for the two houses, and House members would be subject for the first time to a fixed allocation and disclosure of how much each member charges against the free-mail privilege.  The rules changes are attached to a more than $2 billion legislative appropriations bill and, if upheld by the full Senate, they are sure to provoke bitter resentment across the Capitol.  Districtwide mailings by House members would be cut by a third, and going into next year's elections, the Senate action highlights a costly privilege that is alternately a source of power and embarrassment to incumbents.  The District of Columbia bill, approved 238-189 by the House, appropriates an estimated $523.3 million to the city, but its influence extends to the entire municipal budget.  Current law imposes abortion restrictions on city as well as federal funds, and the debate this week was a rematch of last year's, when the amendment was adopted.  The anti-abortion movement will be in a better parliamentary situation in the Senate, but the outcome in the House was closely watched after the recent Supreme Court decision upholding state curbs on abortion.  Those who appeared to reverse their position from a year ago included Rep. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat and potential gubernatorial candidate, who acknowledged he had paid closer attention to the wording of the proposal this year.  "We're taking names and kicking ankles," said Rep. Les AuCoin (D., Ore.).  "But I'd be the last to say we have a new pro-choice majority in here."  NL Industries Inc. said it and its former Baroid division were indicted by a New Orleans federal grand jury for allegedly trying to restrain competition in the sale of fluids used for completing oil and gas wells.  The indictment charges that NL and two other companies conspired to increase their prices for completion fluids by decreasing the amount they paid customers for fluids that weren't used.  In particular, the indictment charges that between early 1986 and early 1987, the companies discussed reducing the amount they would pay for unused fluids and agreed on a reduction to 80% of the original price from 100%.  Kenneth D. Tanner, a retired vice president of an NL division, also was named in the indictment, along with the two other companies and an executive of one of those companies.  NL said it, Baroid Corp. and Mr. Tanner expect to defend themselves vigorously against the charge.  In a transaction last year, the Baroid division was split from NL and became Baroid Corp. NL, a chemicals concern, said Baroid Corp., an oil field services concern, is financially responsible for the claims and its defense.  In 1986 and 1987, Baroid's completion fluids' sales totaled $15.9 million, or about 2% of Baroid's petroleum services revenue, NL said.  About 35% of those sales were subsequently repurchased from customers.  NL said the indictment doesn't involve Baroid's drilling muds business, which was the subject of a lengthy Justice Department investigation that NL says is now closed.  Drilling muds are used in the drilling of an oil or gas well, while completion fluids are salt solutions that are pumped into a well after the drilling is completed.  Giant Group Ltd. posted second-quarter net income of $5.7 million, or $1.30 a share, reversing a loss of $2.5 million a year earlier.  Second-quarter sales rose 82% to $39.5 million from $21.7 million.  In the first half, net was $5.1 million, or $1.29 a share.  Giant had a first-half 1988 loss of $1.8 million.  Sales nearly doubled in the six months to $72.4 million from $36.8 million.  Giant attributed the sales and earnings increases to its acquisition of Golden State Newsprint Co. and to operating improvements at its two cement-producing units.  Giant also owns and operates a newsprint mill and related recycling operations.  Bombardier Inc., a Montreal-based aerospace and transportation concern, said it signed a contract valued at more than 200 million Canadian dollars (US$170 million) with Spain's government for the sale of 10 new Canadair CL-215 firefighting aircraft and 15 CL-215T turboprop retrofit kits.  Bombardier said Spain is the first foreign customer for the Canadair CL-215T turboprop amphibian.  The retrofit kits will be used to convert both the new aircraft and some of the Spanish forestry ministry's existing CL215s to turboprop power, Bombardier said.  The retrofit program will be carried out at the Montreal facilities of Bombardier's Canadair Aerospace Group.  Deliveries of the first retrofitted CL-215T aircraft will begin in 1990.  Falconbridge Ltd., which agreed Wednesday to be acquired by Greenwich, Conn.-based Amax Inc. for about $2.85 billion Canadian (US$2.42 billion), said it expects the proposed takeover to win approval from Canadian regulators.  "There is no prohibition on the sale of (Canadian) mining companies to Americans, so I would assume it would go through," said William James, Falconbridge's chairman, president, and chief executive officer.  Mr. James was responding to comments by James Peterson, federal industry critic for Canada's opposition Liberal Party, who said the Canadian government should block the proposed takeover.  "It's ridiculous that our key resource companies which are coveted by foreign multinationals fall out of our own control," Mr. Peterson said.  Mr. James said he hasn't personally had any discussions with Investment Canada, the government agency that monitors foreign investment in Canada.  "It's my understanding that Amax's lawyers are going after that," he said.  A spokesman for Amax said it also expects the acquisition to win ready approval from Canadian regulators.  He said Amax's legal advisers have "probably had informal talks" with Investment Canada officials, though he couldn't confirm the discussions.  Since Canada's Progressive Conservative Party was elected in 1984, the Canadian government hasn't rejected any large foreign takeovers of Canadian companies, though some purchasers have had to sell assets or meet other conditions in order to win final approval.  An array of high-powered Republicans, personal friends and business associates lobbied the Reagan administration's housing secretary, Samuel Pierce, for assistance on their pet federal projects, according to voluminous files made available yesterday.  Housing and Urban Development officials released Mr. Pierce's personal files from his eight-year tenure, files that shed new light on the widespread lobbying by well-connected Republicans, including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and prominent lawmakers.  The documents show that powerful Republicans had little difficulty getting Mr. Pierce's attention, and, often, the results they were seeking.  In 1983, for instance, Mr. Weinberger wrote to Mr. Pierce supporting federal funding for a housing project for the elderly in Laguna Beach, Calif.  The project had been languishing at HUD for many years and its backers had been unsuccessful in obtaining housing funds, according to one promoter, Robert Cornelison.  In late 1983, Mr. Pierce wrote Mr. Weinberger that the project would receive "every consideration for funding," and Mr. Cornelison said it did get U.S. backing.  Other Republicans who sought and got Mr. Pierce's ear included Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Even Jack Kemp, Mr. Pierce's successor as HUD secretary, who has begun a major overhaul of the agency in the wake of the scandal, asked Mr. Pierce for aid for a Buffalo, N.Y., project when Mr. Kemp represented that area in Congress.  Democrats also contacted Mr. Pierce.  Rep. Barney Frank of Boston, for one, a chief critic of the influence-peddling, mismanagement and fraud that permeated Mr. Pierce's tenure, wrote a note thanking him for approving a $500,000 federal grant for a Massachusetts project.  The Pierce files, contained in 48 boxes, also showed that he often corresponded with members of his former New York law firm, Battle, Fowler, Jaffin & Kheel, and didn't recuse himself when asked by the firm for assistance on HUD projects.  The firm asked him for funding on HUD projects, including the controversial rent-subsidy program, which has been the focus of congressional inquiries of influence-peddling at HUD during the Pierce years.  Mr. Pierce also did personal favors for law firm members.  In March 1986, he asked the State Department to arrange a meeting between his former partner Theodore Kheel and the ambassador to Hungary in connection with a hotel project Mr. Kheel was involved in, according to the Pierce papers.  Mr. Kheel couldn't be reached last night, and Mr. Pierce repeatedly has declined to be interviewed.  In addition, the files added another detail showing that Mr. Pierce supported a controversial HUD project in Durham, N.C.  A former federal housing commissioner has testified that Mr. Pierce ordered her in 1985 to fund the project for elderly housing, but she declined.  Nonetheless, it was funded.  One of the people pushing the project was a former law associate of Mr. Pierce.  A memo in the files from a HUD official, Steve Lowe, said Mr. Pierce "is disposed to have us do as much as possible to make it {the project} succeed."  Mr. Pierce denied earlier this year that he got directly involved in rent-subsidy funding.  The files are replete with snippets of Mr. Pierce's personal and professional activities.  He spent time in 1985 sending out recipes for a political cookbook, including his apparent favorite, Eggs a la Pierce, which contains small pieces of bologna.  At the height of the 1988 presidential campaign, he gave Barbara Bush a silk scarf, and she wrote an effusive thank-you note, calling it a "masterpiece."  And civil-rights leader Coretta Scott King recommended Mr. Pierce for a new job, attorney general, after the post became vacant with Edwin Meese's resignation last year.  But in a letter, President Reagan told her, "I need Sam where he is so he can continue to guide administration policy in this vital area of concern."  Mr. Pierce also kept up a lively correspondence with former President Richard Nixon.  In December, in Mr. Pierce's waning days as HUD chief, Mr. Nixon penned a note on a flattering magazine profile of Mr. Pierce that called him the "unsung hero of the Reagan Revolution."  The former president told Mr. Pierce that his "example is inspiring."  As he was settling into his new job in 1981, Mr. Pierce had to remind the real estate agent who sold him his $150,000 apartment that he could afford the purchase.  To a letter to the agent, he attached a newspaper clipping listing him as one of the millionaires in the Reagan cabinet.  Mr. Pierce, whose ambition was to become a U.S. Supreme Court justice, seemed especially attentive to the wishes of Sen. Thurmond, the influential senior lawmaker who plays an important role in judicial selections.  In an October 1987 letter to Mr. Pierce, Sen. Thurmond thanked the secretary for releasing discretionary funds for two South Carolina projects, including one located in Mr. Thurmond's hometown of Edgefield.  In one document, the senator praised Mr. Pierce as a "man of action" for approving a $6.3 million HUD grant for Charleston, S.C.  The lawmaker often seemed to be sending food to Mr. Pierce, including such Palmetto State favorites as she-crab soup and pecans.  The Pierce files contain many internal HUD reports and memos on the problems involving the agency's biggest co-insurer, DRG Funding Corp., which was in deep trouble with the agency in early 1985.  Mr. Pierce the following May lifted restrictions on the company's underwriting activitiesan action that many HUD officials opposed and said contributed significantly to taxpayer losses attributable to DRG mortgages.  The files show that a number of private company officials, including DRG's president, Donald DeFranceaux, raised money to establish a Samuel R. Pierce scholarship for minority students at Georgetown Preparatory School, a private school here.  An April 1985 letter shows that Mr. Pierce invited Mr. DeFranceaux and others to his office for a meeting on the endowment effort, which raised $13,000.  Fluorocarbon Co., Laguna Niguel, Calif., said it expects earnings for the second quarter ending Saturday to be 25% to 35% lower than the $2.3 million, or 38 cents a share, of the year-earlier period.  The industrial-materials maker also estimated that sales in the period would rise 35% from last year's $60.2 million.  Fluorocarbon blamed the decrease in earnings on the dilutive effects of recent acquisitions and on several unanticipated events, including a strike at its Alabama rubber-gasket plant and a fire that destroyed its seal plant in Belgium.  The strike and fire occurred last month.  In February, Fluorocarbon acquired CHR Industries Inc. of New Haven, Conn., Dixon Industries Inc. of Bristol, R.I., and Bunnell Plastics Inc. of Mickleton, N.J., all industrial-materials makers, from Bundy Corp., a subsidiary of TI Group, London.  SJNB Financial Corp. said it revised its income statement for the second quarter to reflect a change in accounting for losses it had in the sale of U.S. government securities in June.  As a result, the San Jose, Calif., bank holding company said it posted a loss of $1 million; it previously reported net income of $385,000, or 27 cents a share.  The change also means the company's six-month results, previously reported as net of $752,000, or 52 cents a share, are being restated as a loss of $658,000.  The company said the accounting change resulted from "a change of advice given by the company's independent public accountants" regarding treatment of the loss on the securities, which had been held by SJNB's San Jose National Bank unit since 1984.  The company's shares didn't trade yesterday pending announcement of the revised financial statements.  It's becoming mighty expensive for companies to sling mud at each other.  Last week, American Express Co. admitted that its representatives planted false stories about international banker Edmond J. Safra.  The company publicly apologized and agreed to contribute $8 million to Mr. Safra's favorite charities.  Then, Wednesday, Home Shopping Network Inc. was hit with a $100 million defamation verdict for falsely claiming that GTE Corp. phone foul-ups had crippled Home Shopping's sales.  Corporate backbiting is nothing new, but paying for it is rare.  What surprised lawyers about the past week's events was that the aggrieved went to the trouble of doing more than turning the other cheek.  Not only that, the efforts paid off.  As much as they may want to, few companies are willing to sue for defamation.  Criminal-fraud charges apparently have never been brought in such cases.  Even in a civil case, the time and cost involved are only part of the problem; there's also the potential for embarrassing publicity.  But the American Express and Home Shopping situations are likely to stimulate new interest in fighting back against false claims and other assorted dirty tricks.  "The result of the GTE verdict may energize more libel claims by corporations," says libel-law expert Floyd Abrams.  "My own view is that the $100 million verdict will not stand up.  However, it exists for the moment at least and may lead to a change of attitude among companies about asserting libel claims."  Generally, defamation law applies to businesses just as it does to individuals.  That means the company that sues must prove that its competitor made statements that were false and defamatory, that is, harmful to the company's reputation.  In the case of well-known companies, which the law treats as public figures, there's the added burden of proving that the statements were made with knowledge that they were false or with subjective doubt about their truthfulness -- the so-called reckless-disregard standard.  The main difficulty in such suits, says Mr. Abrams, is in gathering the evidence and proving it in court.  Identifying a rumor-monger and getting evidence of his exact words can be a difficult task.  Few companies wish to spend the time, energy and resources to prove such a case if they can settle their dispute without going to court.  "Unless you've got clear and documentary proof or substantiated oral comments, I would think it would be awfully hard to make a case stick," says Kirk O. Hanson, a professor of business ethics at Stanford University Graduate School of Business.  In addition, to prove that a rival company made a false claim, a plaintiff would probably be obligated to turn over company documents it would rather not disclose, particularly to a competitor.  Few companies are willing to go that far.  "When you sue somebody for libel, you give that person a soapbox," says Richard Asche, a New York City litigator.  "When a person is a defendant in a lawsuit, they can say anything they want with complete immunity.  It's more negative publicity in the long run."  Libel litigation is complicated, as well, by questions of whether a damaging allegation will be classified as false, and thus potentially libelous.  Much of what companies contend is defamation could pass as half-truths, statements that aren't legally actionable but damaging nontheless, Mr. Hanson says.  "Someone might say that a particular company has shaky finances or its lead engineer is departing or that it lost an important contract," says Mr. Hanson.  "That is all too frequently a competitive weapon."  Moreover, fiercely competitive organizations often shy away from courtroom confrontations over business tactics because of questions of image.  The "macho mentality" of many corporate board rooms disdains defamation suits because they make a company look "whiny," says Mr. Hanson.  Most companies, he says, "are afraid to look as if they can't take the competition."  Occasionally, however, some companies have no choice but to go to court -- or to threaten such action -- to put a stop to false rumor campaigns and advertising tactics initiated by a competitor.  One of the most egregious examples of malicious gossip in recent years involved rumors in 1987 that Corona Extra beer was contaminated with urine.  Faced with declining sales because of the rumor, the beer's importer, Barton Beers Ltd. of Chicago, filed a defamation lawsuit against a Reno, Nev., wholesaler, Luce & Son Inc.  The rival company carried Heineken -- then the nation's No. 1 import -- but not Corona.  The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Reno, alleged that Luce & Son's salesmen were telling customers that Corona was brewed from "impure" and "contaminated" water; it asked for $3 million in damages.  But the alleged damages weren't as important to Barton as putting a stop to the rumors.  The suit was dropped a month and a half after it was filed, after Luce & Son agreed to state publicly that Corona was free of contaminants.  "What we learned from all that was that the longer it's in the public eye, the more people heard about it and began to take it as reality," says Michael J. Mazzoni, general manager and executive vice president of Barton Beers.  "We felt that if we pushed it, it would keep it in the public eye and make it reality."  In GTE's case, it was in a stronger position to use the court to fight statements against it -- in part because Home Shopping had brought GTE into the courtroom in the first place.  Also, GTE had the advantage of not having to prove who was spreading the allegations against it; Home Shopping was making its statements publicly and in court.  Originally, Home Shopping had sued GTE for $1.5 billion in damages for allegedly providing a grossly inadequate phone system for the Home Shopping operation.  GTE filed a counterclaim alleging that Home Shopping's suit was a sham designed to pass the buck for Home Shopping's own troubles.  The jury sided with GTE and returned a $100 million verdict.  Home Shopping has said it would appeal.  Then there was the case of Mr. Safra, the international banker who won last week's settlement with American Express.  Mr. Safra, who lives in Geneva and controls New York's Republic National Bank, contended that representatives of American Express planted false stories in several European newspapers last year that linked him to drug money laundering.  Through his attorney, New York criminal lawyer Stanley S. Arkin, Mr. Safra traced the source of the smear campaign to representatives of American Express, thus clearing one major evidentiary hurdle in such cases.  He then complained to company officials.  American Express listened to the complaints but rejected them as unfounded.  Even so, Mr. Safra didn't file a lawsuit.  Instead, Mr. Arkin, in his regular column in the New York Law Journal, described a hypothetical case similar to Mr. Safra's and suggested that such conduct could lead to criminal fraud charges.  American Express quickly reconsidered and opted to settle with Mr. Safra.  Yesterday, American Express made public a letter in which a top corporate executive accepted responsibility for the campaign against Mr. Safra.  Harry L. Freeman, the concern's executive vice president of corporate affairs and communications, said he will retire from the company no later than the end of the year.  Fraud charges are commonly brought against companies that make false claims about their own products.  When coupled with an intent to cheat or deceive, false bad claims about a competitor could constitute fraud, Mr. Arkin argued in his law journal article.  The First Amendment provides no protection against such charges, he added, because the constitution doesn't protect untrue statements.  "There is no doubt that there is some type of conduct involving the deliberate release of false information that may not just be libelous but may also be fraudulent," agrees Mr. Abrams, the libel attorney.  But because so few suits are filed over competitive tactics -- and almost none ever decided in court -- the hazy line between what's fair and what's illegal can be hard to pin down.  "The line is not easy to define," says Mr. Hanson.  "But it comes when an organization becomes more concerned with destroying a competing business than in demonstrating that its own goods and services are superior."  He adds, "When the sole purpose of a marketing strategy is the defeat of a certain company, then the company has gone across a line that probably will lead into questionable behavior."  Western Digital Corp. said an internal investigation uncovered two separate incidents of suspected employee theft involving the company's computer chips and printed-circuit boards with a total retail value of about $5 million.  The alleged thefts "won't have a material financial impact on the company," a Western Digital spokeswoman said, adding: "We're in the process now of tightening our inventory controls."  In May, Irvine Police Department investigators arrested and filed criminal charges of grand theft against three former Western Digital employees suspected of stealing about 2,000 printed-circuit boards, Western Digital said.  Yesterday, the company accused three other former employees and a scrap-metal company of fraud in a civil lawsuit filed in state court in Santa Ana, Calif.  The suit seeks punitive and exemplary damages of $10 million.  Western Digital alleged that the employees and scrap-metal company sold as many as one million defective semiconductor chips discarded by the company.  In the suit, Western Digital said its reputation "will be damaged when these improperly obtained scrap products fail to perform" properly.  "We're hopeful of developing evidence that will lead to criminal charges" in the chips case, said Robert Erickson, Western Digital vice president, law and administration.  Mr. Erickson said the company began investigating in May after distributors and dealers told the company that customers could buy circuit boards at low prices.  In July, unusual pricing fluctuations in the market for the company's chips led to discovery of the second suspected theft.  Magna International Inc., Toronto, said its Cosma International Inc. and Decoma International Inc. units plan to offer a minority of their shares to the public in the U.S. and Canada.  Magna, a Markham, Ontario, auto parts manufacturer, said each unit will issue as much as 25% of its equity.  It said proceeds of about 52 million Canadian dollars (US$44.2 million) for Cosma and C$62 million for Decoma will be used mainly to reduce bank debt.  First Boston Corp. is lead manager for the offerings in the U.S. and Scotia-McLeod Inc. and First Boston Canada Ltd. are co-managers in Canada.  Magna said Cosma makes stamped metal automotive parts, assemblies and systems and had sales of C$504 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988.  It said Decoma makes decorative automotive metal and plastic trim and had fiscal 1988 sales of C$423 million.  Two shareholders sued Cray Research Inc. and its top management for an alleged conspiracy to withhold bad news from investors.  Similar lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court here this week accuse the supercomputer maker of seeking to inflate the value of its shares by disseminating "false and misleading" press releases, public filings and other statements as to its financial outlook.  Both suits seek class-action status.  One plaintiff, Michael Rosenberg of Fairfield, Conn., bought 500 shares of Cray at $55.50 a share on May 15, the eve of a restructuring announcement by the company.  Plaintiff Paul Bagoon, as custodian for Scott Bagoon, acquired 100 shares the next day, at $50 a share.  News that Cray planned to spin off founder Seymour Cray's latest machine design unit caused Cray stock to plummet overnight.  Subsequently, when Cray announced surprisingly weak second-quarter results and reduced its projected revenue growth to flat from 10%, its shares fell $2.125.  "We believe both of these suits are without merit," a Cray spokesman said.  "As a company we place great importance on keeping the investment community well-informed.  Our communications to investors are timely and broadly disseminated."  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cray's stock fell 25 cents to close at $43.875.  New Jersey added 11 states and Puerto Rico to the list of those with which it has reciprocal agreements under the state's Interstate Banking Act.  The additional states are Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota and Vermont.  Fourteen other states previously reached similar agreements.  The agreements allow out-of-state banking firms to make acquisitions in New Jersey if New Jersey institutions have the same authority in their states.  New Jersey's banking act has been in effect since Jan. 1, 1988.  Smith Corona Corp., newly public again after more than three years as a Hanson PLC subsidiary, reported a $1.4 million loss for the fourth quarter ended June 30.  The latest period reflects a $14.6 million charge for certain incentive payments made to management "based on an increase in the value of the company."  In the year-earlier period, Smith Corona earned $4 million, after a $1.4 million charge for the payments.  But operating earnings before the charge for the maker of word processors, electronic typewriters and office supplies more than doubled, to $19.1 million from $8.2 million.  And sales climbed 40% to $112.4 million from $80 million.  Smith Corona, of New Canaan, Conn., went public last Friday.  Adjusted for the public offering and related debt financing but excluding the incentive payments, net income for the quarter would have tripled to $11.6 million, or 38 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 12 cents a share.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Smith Corona shares closed at $21, unchanged.  Phelps Dodge Corp. said its venture with Sumitomo Corp. of Japan will spend $112 million to expand copper capacity at a mining operation in Morenci, Arizona.  The expansion would add 70,000 tons of electrowon cathode copper annually to capacity, beginning in mid-1991 and continuing through the end of the decade, Phelps Dodge said.  Electrowinning is a refinement process using a liquid copper solution.  The copper producer, which operates the mine, said it has an 85% interest in the venture, with interests controlled by Sumitomo holding the remainder.  Most of the expansion would be in the project's Northwest Extension, a mineral deposit adjoining the existing Morenci mine to the north, it said.  Phelps Dodge said it hopes by 1993 that more than half its copper annually will be produced through low-cost solvent extraction and electrowinning methods.  According to the company, Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford estimates that an additional $15 million in state property and severance taxes between 1990 and 2008 will be generated by the expansion.  The governor has pledged to support relocation of two miles of state highway near the Morenci mine to make the expansion possible, Phelps Dodge said.  Pic 'N' Save Corp. said second-quarter net income fell 22% to $6.4 million, or 18 cents a share, despite a 23% sales gain.  The Carson, Calif., retail discount store chain attributed the earnings fall to costs of opening six stores and expenses associated with its Dec. 1 acquisition of the Job Lot Pushcart store chain.  A year ago, the company had net of $8.2 million, or 21 cents a share.  Sales rose to $101.8 million from $82.9 million.  Pic 'N' Save also reported July sales of $29 million, a 25% increase from last year's $23.2 million.  But the company said the month's figures fall short of recent trends, reflecting reduced advertising and merchandising in anticipation of a campaign to be introduced this month.  Net income for the first six months was $11.8 million, or 33 cents a share, down 22% from $15.2 million, or 40 cents a share.  Sales gained 25% to $195.9 million from $156.9 million.  Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 342,000 during the week ended July 22 from 353,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department said.  The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended July 15 increased to a seasonally adjusted 2,257,000, or 2.2% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from 2,250,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2%.  Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended July 15 fell to 2,227,500 from a revised 2,237,800 a week earlier.  These figures aren't seasonally adjusted.  Morrison Knudsen Corp. announced the appointment of a new president and the naming of Peter V. Ueberroth, former commissioner of major-league baseball, as a director.  Frank M. Adams, a Morrison Knudsen executive vice president, was named president and chief operating officer.  As president, Mr. Adams succeeds William M. Agee, who remains Morrison Knudsen's chairman and chief executive officer.  The title of chief operating officer is new to the company.  Mr. Adams once was president of Bendix Aircraft Systems Co., a unit of Allied Signal Inc.  The company also named Michael J. Shirley as vice president of finance and treasurer, and Kenneth M. Jantz as a vice president and controller.  Both are longtime Morrison Knudsen employees.  Mr. Shirley succeeds James Bowden, who resigned.  The company declined to elaborate.  Mr. Jantz succeeds Allen R. Morris, who is taking early retirement, the company said.  The personnel moves come as the construction and engineering concern is beginning to return to profitability after a long and painful restructuring program under Mr. Agee, who assumed command of the company in August 1988.  The appointment of Mr. Ueberroth increases the number of directors to 12.  Mesa Limited Partnership said it had a second-quarter net loss of $13.4 million, largely because of lower natural gas prices and higher interest costs related to last year's purchase of Tenneco Inc. properties.  The oil and gas master limited partnership, led by T. Boone Pickens Jr., also had an $11.3 million gain from the sale of oil and gas properties and a $12.6 million gain from securities sales in the quarter.  But that wasn't enough to offset low gas prices and $45.6 million in interest expense associated with the $715 million purchase of Tenneco properties late last year.  In the 1988 second quarter, net was $3.7 million, or nine cents a unit.  Those results included $26.5 million in interest expense and about $3.3 million in securities gains.  Revenue rose 17.3% to $83.3 million from $71 million.  For the six months, net was $1.2 million, or 14 cents a unit, down 95% from $23.1 million, or 26 cents a unit, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 13% to $188.4 million from $166.2 million.  MOSLEM EXTREMISTS SUSPENDED a threat to kill a U.S. hostage in Lebanon.  A fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, announced that it was "freezing" its threat to kill captive Joseph Cicippio, and suggested that Iran may have interceded to postpone the slaying.  The kidnappers implied that Cicippio could be killed "within days" unless Israel met new terms.  These included releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners, as well as freeing a Shiite Moslem cleric abducted by Israel last week.  The White House called the suspension an encouraging development, but said it still didn't meet U.S. demands for the release of all hostages.  ---  PIERCE WAS LOBBIED by an array of Republicans for federal housing projects.  According to the former HUD chief's personal files, a number of high-powered Republicans, personal friends and business associates -- including ex-Defense Secretary Weinberger and then-Rep.  Kemp -- sought Pierce's assistance.  The documents, released by HUD aides, show that well-connected officials had little difficulty getting Pierce's attention, and, often, the results they were seeking.  Kemp, currently HUD secretary, has begun an overhaul of HUD programs in the wake of the scandal.  Several Democrats also sought Pierce's aid.  ---  Federal researchers have concluded that the antiviral drug AZT can delay the development of AIDS in infected people with mild symptoms.  National Institutes of Health scientists announced the results of a landmark study, which could help many of the 900,000 to 1.4 million people in the U.S. believed infected with the virus.  ---  A federal judge in Indiana ordered a U.S. art dealer to return four sixth-century mosaics to the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus.  The judge ruled that the suburban Indianapolis dealer, who purchased the artworks for $1.1 million last summer in Switzerland, never obtained proper title and hasn't any right to possess the mosaics.  ---  The Soviet Union has accepted a U.S. demand that the superpowers inspect each other's chemical-weapons stockpiles before an international ban on the weapons is signed, Soviet officials in Geneva said.  Moscow's position was conveyed in a paper presented to Secretary of State Baker by Foreign Minister Shevardnadze last week in Paris.  ---  The House passed a $27 billion transportation bill increasing FAA appropriations by 17.5% in fiscal 1990 and imposing a permanent smoking ban on commercial airline flights of two hours or less.  Legislation liberalizing abortion limits in the nation's capital also was approved.  ---  Two California scientists said preliminary tests in Parkinson's disease patients suggest that a medicine born of research on heroin-like street drugs may slow the disorder's progress.  They said the medicine, deprenyl, postponed the onset of severe symptoms in a small group of patients with early signs of the disease.  ---  The Voyager 2 spacecraft has identified three previously unknown moons orbiting the planet Neptune, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., announced.  The researchers expect more satellites to be uncovered this month.  The space probe was launched in 1977 and has passed Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.  ---  Poland's Premier Kiszczak offered a Solidarity senator a cabinet position in his new government.  But the lawmaker, an adviser to the union on health policy, rejected the bid and said Solidarity parliamentarians didn't plan to enter Warsaw's government.  ---  Rafsanjani was inaugurated as Iran's president, and he pledged to continue the 10-year-old Islamic revolution, Tehran's official news agency reported.  Rafsanjani, who served as parliamentary speaker for nine years, apparently didn't make any reference to possible U.S. retaliation over hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.  ---  PLO leader Arafat defended the principle of armed struggle, calling it a "legitimate weapon" against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Palestinian representatives from the occupied lands met in Jerusalem with a U.S. envoy and rejected Israel's election plans and demanded that the Jewish state swap land for peace.  ---  South Africa opened a five-week election that excludes blacks and is likely to return the governing party to power for the 10th time since 1948.  A coalition of anti-apartheid groups urged a boycott of the balloting for delegates to segregated white, mixed-race and Indian parliamentary chambers.  ---  A public-health group said malfunctions and design defects in heart pacemakers and other medical devices have caused injuries and deaths that have gone unreported to the FDA.  The group said FDA records show that at least 35 manufacturers have flouted a law requiring prompt reporting of such malfunctions.  ---  The Census Bureau said that seven of the 10 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the U.S. are in Florida, and that all of the 61 metropolitan areas that grew at double the pace of the nation as a whole are in the South or West.  The report said the U.S. population grew 7.4% between 1980 and 1987.  ---  Olympic Airways plane crashed into a mountainside on the Aegean island of Samos, officials reported.  All 34 people aboard were believed killed.  The twin-engine plane was on a domestic flight from Salonica.  The pilot didn't report any problems before the incident, authorities said.  West Germany's jobless rate in July rose to 7.7% from 7.4% in June, but the count was down sharply from a July 1988 unemployment rate of 8.5% as the job market continued to respond to a second year of rapid economic growth.  Though feared to be showing early signs of overheating, the economy has widened employment opportunities as companies expand production and add extra work shifts.  Last month, the government counted 27,600,000 employed persons in West Germany, the highest employment level in the republic's 40-year history.  The government also reported that West Germany's annual inflation rate during July was revised downward to 3% from a preliminary estimate of 3.1%.  July consumer prices were down 0.2% from the preceding month, reversing a 0.2% monthly increase in June, when prices were up 3.1% from a year ago.  West German policy makers are fighting to hold inflation to around 3% this year after prices rose an average 1.2% in 1988.  The Bundesbank since December has announced successive hikes in interest rates to stem inflation and support the mark in currency markets.  The Playboy Channel, the troubled cable-television arm of Playboy Enterprises Inc., will be folded in December and replaced with a new pay-per-view TV service, Playboy announced.  In an interview, Christie Hefner, Playboy's chairwoman and chief executive officer, said launching a pay-per-view service with an entire evening's entertainment for a flat fee was more economical than retooling the struggling pay-subscription cable channel.  Ms. Hefner said the new service will be available in 2.5 million homes with pay-per-view capability, making Playboy the third-largest pay-per-view service.  The Playboy Channel, launched in 1982, claims 400,000 subscribers, said a Playboy spokesman.  It has been plagued by a high "churn" rate, in which subscribers sample the service but drop it.  Separately, Playboy announced that it will launch a new one-hour European TV show this fall, "Playboy Late Night."  Because European broadcast standards are less stringent than those in the U.S., the magazine-format show will include nudity but no explicit sex.  Joseph W. O'Donnell resigned as chairman of Campbell-Mithun-Esty, leaving William Dunlap, the ad agency's chief executive, to assume the post.  Mr. O'Donnell, 47 years old, resigned amid mounting speculation that he would either quit voluntarily or be forced to leave by the company's parent, Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, which industry executives say has been unhappy with his performance.  In a memo to employees, Mr. O'Donnell wrote: "For whatever reasons, justified or not, mounting conjecture in the press and on the street about my tenure is getting in the way of moving forward agencywide and has proven particularly debilitating here in New York as it relates to new business."  Neither Mr. O'Donnell nor the agency would comment beyond that statement.  Saatchi & Saatchi officials couldn't be reached for comment.  Mr. O'Donnell came to what was then William Esty Co. in March 1987 from J. Walter Thompson Co., where he had been heir apparent to Chief Executive Officer Don Johnston.  He had been abruptly fired from JWT, however, for passing on an unsolicited buy-out bid for the company from an outside group.  That bid helped put JWT in play, ultimately leading to its purchase by London's WPP Group.  Saatchi & Saatchi hired Mr. O'Donnell in the hopes he would be able to turn around the staid fortunes of its ailing Esty unit.  Instead, Esty's problems seemed to worsen under his leadership.  Soon after he arrived, the agency lost its largest client, the $150 million Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. account.  It also resigned the $40 million MasterCard International account, an account sources indicate would have been lost if Esty hadn't given it up.  Although neither loss is attributed to Mr. O'Donnell, the agency never fully recovered.  Esty did later win Chrysler Corp.'s big Jeep Eagle account, but that gain didn't come close to offsetting the many client defections.  Mr. O'Donnell's attempts to raise the creative reputation of the agency never panned out.  Shortly after coming on board, he hired Marvin Honig, formerly an executive vice president of ad agency FCB/Leber Katz Partners, to Esty's top creative spot.  But executives agree Mr. Honig's creative talents never blossomed, and he left the agency several months ago.  Industry executives say Mr. O'Donnell, a dynamic individual, represented everything that former stodgy Esty management didn't.  Under his tenure, however, the agency continued to weaken, forcing Saatchi & Saatchi to merge it with its Campbell-Mithun Advertising unit last July.  Saatchi & Saatchi put Mr. Dunlap, 50, in charge of operations, effectively relegating Mr. O'Donnell to the sidelines.  Meanwhile, client losses and a failure to attract enough new business continued to plague the New York operation.  Earlier this year, it lost the $25 million American Home Products Corp. account.  Another longtime client, Tambrands Inc., is reviewing Campbell-Mithun-Esty and its other two agencies with plans to consolidate the business at one shop.  With Mr. O'Donnell's departure, management responsibilities for Campbell-Mithun-Esty's New York office will be assumed by Mr. Dunlap and two other executives, Lawrence Wassong, the New York office's president, and Richard Johnson, its chairman and chief creative officer.

More than 25 of the 46 futures traders who were indicted on fraud charges might begin cooperating with the expanding federal inquiry as early as next week, say people familiar with the indictments.  These people say the rapid rate at which these traders are expected to be "turned" by the government suggests that the quality of the evidence against them was higher than many of their attorneys expected just weeks ago.  Widespread cooperation also would indicate that the unprecedented probe could spread well beyond the initial groups of floor brokers and traders targeted on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, say the people familiar with the indictments, made Wednesday.  "Once our agents have gathered evidence in a case like this, the next important step is getting insiders to cooperate with the investigation," says James D. McKenzie, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Chicago field office.  The indictments capped a 2 1/2-year investigation in which at least four FBI agents posed as futures traders on the two exchanges and gathered evidence, including secret tape recordings, of alleged futures trading fraud.  Mr. McKenzie, as well as U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, declined to comment on the number of traders who were cooperating with the investigation.  According to exchange members and defense attorneys, traders who are cooperating range from relatively small traders such as Melanie Kosar in the Board of Trade's Treasury-bond futures pit, to John Eggum, formerly one of the most active CBOT soybean-futures traders.  The exchange members and defense attorneys also said that others who are cooperating, such as Daniel Parz, a yen-futures trader on the Chicago Merc, are members of broker groups that include some of the most powerful traders on that exchange.  Mr. Parz is a member of a group with John Baker and Thomas Crouch, who were indicted Wednesday and face possible seizure of assets and trading profits if convicted of racketeering charges.  Mr. Baker broke down and cried while trading on Tuesday when he learned that Mr. Parz was cooperating, traders said.  Lawyers for Ms. Kosar and Mr. Eggum declined to comment.  Neither Messrs.  Parz, Baker nor Mr. Crouch could be reached for comment.  Several traders who were indicted apparently decided within the past few weeks to cooperate with the investigation after they heard tape recordings made by the agents and other evidence of allegedly fraudulent trades in which they participated, people familiar with the indictments said.  The quality of the evidence against them, rather than the threat of harsh penalties under anti-racketeering statutes, played a major role in their decision, defense attorneys said.  A handful of traders have been cooperating for months.  "The tapes are outstanding," says a lawyer who represents a trader now cooperating.  "They're crystal clear.  Some of them have prices quoted in the background while orders are being filled at different prices.  You can hear the numbers."  The apparent willingness to cooperate is a far cry from the public posturing of many defense attorneys in the months since the investigation surfaced in mid-January.  These attorneys maintained that the investigation was based on technical trading violations that shouldn't be the subject of a federal investigation.  Some attorneys still say this is the case.  Despite the barrage of publicity surrounding the indictments, several of those indicted returned to the pits on both exchanges.  But it was hardly business as usual.  Traders on the Chicago Merc trading floor stood overlooking the Japanese yen-futures pit to look at where the indicted traders stood.  "There was a lot of speculating going on about who was going to go down next," said one trader.  Both exchanges have asked those indicted not to handle customer trades as brokers but have allowed them to continue to trade for their own accounts.  One indicted soybean-futures trader arrived at the Board of Trade yesterday only to find that the exchange had mistakenly deactivated his membership identification badge, meaning he couldn't pass through a set of turnstiles onto the trading floor, an exchange member said.  He said the badge was quickly reactivated.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Wednesday named eight of the indicted traders as having settled administrative charges with the federal agency.  The commission said the eight -- four in the Board of Trade's soybean-futures pit, three in the Chicago Merc's Japanese-yen pit and one in the Merc's Swiss-franc pit -- are cooperating with the federal inquiry.  Defense attorneys who read the indictments said at least seven or eight additional traders who were indicted also are already cooperating with the investigation.  The attorneys made that assessment based on the fact that these traders were charged with only one or two counts of fraud in the indictments.  David J. Skrodski, a former soybean-futures trader, settled CFTC charges against him and has agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud, which is a felony, and one count of pre-arranged trading, which is a misdemeanor, his attorney said.  Mr. Skrodski began cooperating in May, shortly before he sold his seat on the Board of Trade.  The attorney declined to comment upon the extent to which Mr. Skrodski would provide information to the government about other traders.  Some attorneys said that their clients are cooperating, but that they aren't caving in to government demands for information on other traders.  Craig LaCrosse, a soybean-futures trader, agreed recently to plead guilty to two counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act, said his attorney, Matthias A. Lydon.  Mr. LaCrosse is answering the government's questions about his actions, Mr. Lydon said.  But, the lawyer maintained, Mr. LaCrosse "isn't implicating anybody in any fraud" or "acknowledging that he knows of any fraud of customers."  Help-wanted advertising, an indication of hiring patterns, dropped in June to its lowest level since February 1987, the Conference Board said.  The industry-supported, non-profit economic research concern's help-wanted advertising index fell to 148 in June from 154 in May.  The seasonally adjusted index in May had declined five points from April.  The year 1967 is used as a base of 100.  The June drop is the first time in nearly two years the index has moved significantly outside the range of 155 to 165.  "Employment growth has slowed," Kenneth Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said, "especially in the cyclically sensitive durable-goods industries."  Also, the average hourly pay rate in June was unchanged from May.  "This suggests that the labor markets are no longer so tight as to drive up wage rates," Mr. Goldstein said.  Only 18% of the 51 major newspapers measured in June had rising volumes of ads, down from 24% in May.  This level is sharply lower than in some recent months; for example, 86% of newspapers registered gains in April.  About 24% had rising volumes in June 1988.  The west south-central region, which is made up of New Orleans, Dallas, Tulsa, Okla., and San Antonio, Texas, had rising volume of about 2.2% in June.  All other regions had declines in ad volume, ranging from a decrease of 3.3% for the Pacific Coast to a 12.6% drop for the west north-central region of Kansas City, Mo., Minneapolis and St. Louis, and an 11.8% decline for New England.  As Chicago's futures industry began to recover from the initial blow of Wednesday's indictments, defense attorneys attacked the fairness of the government's case.  Although the evidence compiled by prosecutors already has persuaded a number of traders to opt for guilty pleas, some lawyers say the Justice Department used a blunderbuss instead of a marksman's rifle to bag its prey.  As a result, while defense attorneys try to pry holes in the government's case, they'll also argue that their clients were only pursuing traditional pit practices.  At the core of the government's cases in at least half of the indictment counts are charges of fraud that will be the most difficult for defense attorneys to combat.  These are cases where prearranged trades are alleged to have enriched trader-brokers at the expense of their clients.  Assuming the government can prove its facts, it will be hard for defense attorneys to dispute that there is a legally mandated fiduciary duty that exists between a broker and his client, according to John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor and leading securities and criminal law expert.  On the other hand, defense lawyers will try to show that their clients lacked the specific intent to defraud their customers required under current Supreme Court interpretation of the mail-fraud statutes.  Similarly, while prosecutors could very well prove some of the acts necessary to gain a conviction under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, defendants may be able to defeat the attempt to label the entire Chicago Mercantile Exchange or Chicago Board of Trade as the criminal "enterprises" required for prosecution under that law.  Even if the government had claimed that individual pits were "enduring recognized" enterprises for racketeering purposes as the law requires, observers say, prosecutors would be pointing to groups too large or amorphous to make the charge stick.  "When you're talking about a whole pit, let alone an exchange, some of these guys don't even know each other," according to one criminal defense lawyer not involved in these cases.  But the indictments also go after common market practices that aren't specifically prohibited under federal law and some of which aren't even violations of exchange rules.  Instead, the indictments in effect argue that such common occurrences as front-running or curb (after hours) trading violate general federal strictures against wire or mail fraud.  Defense attorneys charge that this is an attempt to achieve by criminal prosecution what more properly should be done by legislation or regulation.  Until the indictments, these practices were "almost customary," according to Thomas Anthony Durkin, attorney for yen pit trader Sam A. Cali.  U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas "isn't wrong for investigating the marketplace.  The 'Catch-22' is, do you all of a sudden label everybody racketeers {for long-accepted practices} because they were standing next to the guy with the microphone?"  Mr. Durkin added, "If they had had 50 moles, the whole place would have been shut down."  There are currently no specific laws against front-running, the practice where a broker trades for his own account in anticipation of a major order from one of his customers.  Although Congress is attempting to rush limitations through in the wake of the Chicago investigation, the current prosecutions are "a case of regulation by indictment," according to Mr. Coffee.  "Instead of prosecuting people in an area where the government thinks reforms needed, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should adopt rules and spell out clear-cut policies," Mr. Coffee said.  "But you don't go after people who are behaving in a way that is traditional to the system.  You don't use the criminal law to intervene."  Defense lawyers were also quick to note that federal prosecutors launched their public relations salvo Wednesday without the traditional estimate of how much money the alleged crimes involved.  The U.S. attorney's office has said only that the charges involve thousands of trades and hundreds of cheated clients.  The prosecutors may be avoiding a total-dollar estimate of money allegedly defrauded from investors because it's less than $1 million, some defense attorneys speculate, and therefore unimpressive to the news media and the public.  "That doesn't give you many bragging rights," said one defense attorney.  Nevertheless, the leaders of the exchanges may move more quickly than even the prosecutors.  The Merc has already tried to claim the seats of any traders ultimately convicted in the scandal to use for "restitution" to defrauded investors.  If the prosecutors get their way, however, traders convicted under RICO would forfeit their seats to the government before the Merc could touch them.  And the Merc's fiery leader, Leo Melamed, seems intent on preserving his exchange's self-regulation.  Yesterday in a news conference at the Merc, Mr. Melamed declared with fists clenched that any government ukase on the exchange's rules wouldn't be good "for America."  To clean up house at the Merc, Mr. Melamed vowed to "instill the fear of God" into "a handful of immoral people."  But Mr. Coffee doubts that will be enough: "As long as you have the open-outcry, dual-trading system built in to the Chicago exchanges, there will always be problems in the area of front-running and trading in general with knowledge of the clients' orders.  If you want to do something about this, you end the dual trading system."  Seven of the 10 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the U.S. are in Florida, a new Census Bureau report shows.  The population of the Naples, Fla., area grew faster than that of any other metropolitan area between 1980 and 1987, surging 48.8% to 127,900.  All of the 61 metropolitan areas that grew at a pace twice as fast as the nation as a whole are in the South or West.  The population of the entire country grew 7.4% between 1980 and 1987.  Other Florida metropolitan areas on the Census Bureau's top 10 list are Ocala, Fort Myers-Cape Coral, Fort Pierce, the Cape Canaveral area, West Palm Beach and Orlando.  All but Orlando are largely resort or retirement communities, the Census Bureau said.  Metropolitan areas outside Florida making the top 10 list are Austin, Texas, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas, and Las Cruces, N.M.  The government defines a metropolitan area as "a population nucleus" of at least 50,000, usually a city, plus its immediate suburbs and adjacent communities "having a high degree of economic and social integration."  The Census Bureau now identifies 282 such areas.  Among big cities, the fastest-growing metropolitan areas are Phoenix, up 29.8% in the period, and Dallas-Fort Worth, up 27.1%.  Of the 54 areas that lost population between 1980 and 1987, 41 were in the Northeast and Midwest.  The biggest percentage decline in population was in Duluth, Minn., where the Census Bureau estimates the population fell 9.4%.  ROYAL TRUSTCO Ltd., Toronto, said it plans to issue 11 million common shares at C$18.50 (US$15.74) each for proceeds of 203.5 million Canadian dollars ($173.1 million).  The financial-services concern, which is indirectly controlled by Toronto financiers Edward and Peter Bronfman, said the issue is expected to close Aug. 31.  At last report, Royal Trustco had about 107 million shares outstanding.  The issue would be the second stage of Royal Trustco's plan announced in February -- following its agreement to acquire Pacific First Financial Corp., a Tacoma, Wash., thrift holding concern -- to raise an additional C$250 million of permanent capital to finance acquisitions.  In March, Royal Trustco raised C$100 million through the issue of perpetual preferred shares.  Lead managers for the latest issue are Gordon Capital Corp. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc., while the co-managers are Burns Fry Ltd., Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., Scotia-McLeod Ltd. and Wood Gundy Inc.  British Airways PLC reported a 19% rise in first-quarter pretax profit to #96 million ($159 million) from #81 million in the year-earlier first quarter.  Revenue rose to #1.173 billion from #1.019 billion.  Profit attributable to shareholders, the equivalent of net income, rose to #62 million from #53 million.  The carrier's chairman, Lord King, termed the performance "good" but noted results for the same period last year were depressed by the British Caledonian acquisition.  Iranian-inspired terrorists put off a death threat against a U.S. hostage, ushering in a period of increasingly complicated, high-stakes diplomatic manuvering over hostages in the Mideast.  The Shiite group holding Joseph Cicippio, which calls itself the Revolutionary Justice Organization, announced in Lebanon that it is "freezing" a threat to kill him.  The group seemed to suggest that Iran may have interceded to put off the execution.  But it also significantly upped the ante in the hostage drama by saying it isn't demanding merely the release of a Shiite leader kidnapped last week by Israel but also the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite prisoners held by Israel.  The statement said the proposal would be withdrawn if it isn't acted on "within days."  That implied that the death sentence could be reimposed, but the statement didn't explicitly say so.  If Mr. Cicippio had been killed, administration officials said, his murder probably would have brought military retaliation by President Bush.  The president's "leanings would have been toward taking some action" against a site on a list of military targets in Lebanon developed by the Pentagon, one administration aide said.  Some officials regard the move as an encouraging sign that the Shiite groups holding hostages in Lebanon -- most of which are believed to be affiliated with the Hezbollah political and military organization -- may be interested in Israel's offer to swap Western hostages for Moslem prisoners held by Israel.  Diplomatic sources said Israel has been holding discussions with Shiite leaders or their intermediaries inside Lebanon.  The U.S. has told Israel that the Bush administration won't participate in any effort to swap prisoners held by Israel for U.S. hostages because doing so would violate U.S. policy against negotiating with terrorists.  But the administration also is signaling to Israel that it won't try to stop the Israelis from brokering such a deal.  White House officials expressed relief that Mr. Cicippio had been spared and that the administration has dodged, at least temporarily, tough decisions on military retaliation.  But privately, some administration aides also were troubled by the terrorists' gambit, fearing the Bush administration may be slipping into a cycle of successive terrorist threats that will preoccupy the U.S. government and draw attention to extremists' demands.  "Clearly they're milking this for all they can," said one senior Bush administration official.  The suspension of the death threat against Mr. Cicippio ended the immediate pressure on President Bush to prepare for a military strike against either Lebanese extremists or Iran, the country the extremists look to for inspiration.  Since a terrorist group calling itself the Organization for the Oppressed on Earth claimed on Monday to have killed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, U.S. Navy ships have been steaming in the direction of Lebanon and Iran.  Pentagon planners continued working on military options, but Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney left Washington Wednesday to spend a long weekend in his native Wyoming.  A Pentagon spokesman, Fred Hoffman, said Mr. Cheney plans to deliver a speech on environmental matters and attend the 30th reunion of his high school class in Casper during the weekend.  But while the military option may fade for a few days, the hostage drama is opening intriguing diplomatic possibilities.  One is that Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who took office just yesterday, is heeding U.S. threats that Iran would be held responsible for the death of Mr. Cicippio and is helping to restrain the terrorists.  The captors said they were putting off Mr. Cicippio's killing "out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution."  If he is willing to restrain the terrorists, Mr. Rafsanjani could use the current crisis to demonstrate to the Bush administration that he will temper Iranian behavior.  White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the administration can't point to "any specific improvements" in relations with Iran, but he said the White House hopes the groundwork has been laid for improvements in the future.  The other diplomatic possibility is that Hezbollah and its splinter terror groups may be considering the Israeli offer of a swap in which Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, the captured Shiite religious leader, and other Lebanese Shiites held by Israel would be released in return for all Western hostages in Lebanon.  Publicly, Hezbollah has rejected the idea.  But Israeli officials insist that there remains a chance for some kind of exchange.  ---  John J. Fialka contributed to this article.  Philip Morris Cos. is betting that Next, its "de-nicotined" product, will do for cigarettes what its Sanka brand once did for coffee.  So it is no coincidence that the tobacco giant is pitching the new smoke to consumers just like decaf.  Packs of Next carry the word "De-Nic" beneath the Next logo.  The brand's ads proudly proclaim: "Introducing de-nicotined tobacco with rich flavor."  And, of course, the copy also tells consumers that the nicotine-removal process is natural.  Philip Morris's normally chatty tobacco PR people are still refusing to talk about the product or its positioning, even though Next is being tested in Toledo, Ohio; Omaha, Neb.; and Hartford, Conn.  The campaign, created by Leo Burnett Co., is appearing in local and national media including regional editions of Time, Newsweek and People.  But marketers speculate that the company's "Smoke Sanka" strategy is designed to make low-nicotine Next seem as soothingly familiar to puffers as possible.  "They have set up a simple analogy," adds Al Ries, chairman of Trout & Ries Inc., a New York marketing-strategy firm.  "In the minds of people, having a smoke and a cup of coffee tend to be things you do together."  Moreover, the caffeine comparison enables Philip Morris to imply it has a safer cigarette -- without actually asserting it.  "What makes the coffee analogy very powerful is that they have in a sense established the safety position for Next," adds Mr. Ries.  Philip Morris's tack with Next also is similar to the way it introduced Merit and the concept of low tar in the 70s.  Hal Grant, senior vice president of marketing at tobacco concern Liggett Group Inc., describes the Next campaign as "really a kind of regurgitation of Merit."  He adds: "This is newsworthy not image advertising: You don't see a cowboy riding across the plains." (What you do see is a pack of Next cigarettes.) By keeping Next's message short -- and simple -- Philip Morris has avoided the mistakes RJR Nabisco Inc. made last year, when it introduced its now-defunct smokeless cigarette called Premier.  Wordy copy explaining Premier, a clever contraption that delivered nicotine but no tar, proved just as confusing to consumers as the product.  But Philip Morris faces other challenges.  Some industry critics warn the use of the word "de-nicotined" is problematic and could draw Federal Trade Commission scrutiny.  At issue is whether consumers interpret it to mean no nicotine or so little nicotine that there are no health risks involved.  "This word is potentially misleading," says Cliff Douglas, assistant director of the Coalition on Smoking or Health.  "Some consumers will consider the product to be safe or safer than other tobacco products."  (In fact, Next has 0.1 milligrams of nicotine, the same amount as in Carlton and Now.  But Next contains significantly higher levels of tar.)  Marketers also question Next's focus on the issue of choice in the ad copy.  Some ads boast that the brand "offers smokers a choice they have never had."  Others declare: "The Next choice is yours."  But an ad man for a rival tobacco company cautions: "If you are a smoker worried about tar and nicotine and you are invited to make choices, your next choice may be to quit altogether."  In any event, Philip Morris clearly believes it has a winner on its hands.  Distributors in the cities where the brand is being tested say the company is sparing no expense to launch the product, even by its own lavish standards.  As an incentive for distributors to take on the brand, Philip Morris is paying them $60 a case -- double the industry's standard rate.  Even more unusual, salespeople are getting paid a handsome 20 cents for every carton they sell.  At Geo.  Canalos Inc., Dennis Grahl, vice president of merchandising, says he hasn't even begun giving his Toledo-area customers introductory "buy one, get one free" deals, but has already had to reorder Next three times.  "I think Philip Morris is on to something," he says.  Greg Moses, a two-pack-a-day Cambridge Lights smoker in Sandusky, Ohio, who has sampled Next, agrees.  "Carltons and Now are like sucking on air," Mr. Moses says.  "These Nexts have a flavor and that's what a smoker wants."  ---  Ad Notes. . . .   HISPANIC ADS: D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, New York, acquired a minority interest in Sosa & Associates, a Hispanic ad agency based in San Antonio, Texas.  Terms weren't disclosed.  Additionally, Grand Metropolitan's Burger King, which earlier this year gave its national ad account to DMB&B, awarded its Hispanic ad account to Sosa.  Billings weren't disclosed.  The account had previously been handled by Castor Spanish International, which because of a recent merger is now known as Castor GS&B Advertising.  NEW ACCOUNTS: Mennen Co., Morristown, N.J., awarded its $7 million to $10 million ad account for its Home Expression Group division to Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson, New York.  The account had been handled by Caldwell Van Riper, Indianapolis. . . .  Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, awarded the ad account for its Top Job household cleaner to Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, New York.  The account had been handled by Saatchi & Saatchi Co.'s Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, New York. . . .  Tyco Toys, Mt. Laurel, N.J., awarded an additional $11 million in billings for its View-Master Ideal unit to Bozell, New York, which has handled Tyco's advertising since 1985.  Congressional negotiators and the Bush administration pushed aside the biggest obstacle facing the $166 billion savings-and-loan bill by agreeing on a compromise plan to finance the rescue legislation.  But House members who opposed the administration's roundabout funding plan that wouldn't be included in the federal budget said the agreement could encounter a tough fight on the floor today.  "There were a lot of members who told me they wouldn't favor the plan if it's not on budget," said Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.).  Added Rep. Don Pease (D., Ohio): "It's going to be a tough sell."  The fight over the complicated financing has loomed as a huge tug-of-war ever since the bill was proposed in February.  The president's plan, backed by the Senate, would raise $50 billion through industry bonds to close or merge sick S&Ls.  It would cost $5 billion more than the original House plan over 30 years, but wouldn't increase the budget deficit and would preserve the appearance that statutory deficit-reduction goals were being met.  The House's on-budget plan would be less costly, but would add to official deficit calculations and would require a waiver from the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.  In late-night negotiations between lawmakers and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman, conferees narrowly approved a plan that would place $20 billion of spending on the fiscal 1989 budget.  The remaining $30 billion would be raised over two years through industry bonds, which wouldn't be counted as part of the budget.  Last week, House and Senate negotiators settled on the House financing plan.  But when the House-Senate compromise was taken up on the House floor yesterday, a letter from President Bush was waiting.  "If the conference report is presented to me in its current form," he wrote, "I will veto the bill."  Despite the threat, the House approved the original conference agreement by a vote of 221-199.  But the legislation was derailed when it moved to the Senate last night.  As he had long threatened, Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) raised a procedural obstacle to the House plan.  Although senators voted 54-46 in favor of waiving Gramm-Rudman, the effort failed because the law requires at least 60 votes to waive the law's provisions.  "The bailout under the best plan is going to be very costly and painful to the taxpayer," Sen. Gramm said.  "If we are going to let fiscal restraint get killed in process, then I think the costs will be much greater."  The Senate action bounced the bill back to conference.  In often tense negotiations late last night, Secretary Brady finally conceded that the administration could live with $20 billion on the federal budget in the current fiscal year.  Because the spending comes after Gramm-Rudman's deadline for calculating this year's deficit, a waiver won't be required.  But the support for the compromise was lukewarm.  Following its approval by House negotiators on a 26-22 vote, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowksi (D., Ill.) said he hadn't decided which way he would vote on the bill.  However, Congress is scheduled to begin a one-month recess after today's session and is unlikely to leave the emergency bill unfinished.  Faced with such a deadline, the administration altered its position significantly, too.  In recent months, Mr. Brady had flatly rejected a similar proposal to take advantage of the Gramm-Rudman loophole in fiscal 1989.  The administration has been loath to set a precedent of a granting $50 billion waiver from Gramm-Rudman, which Mr. Bush said in his letter, "represents the only available institutional requirement for fiscal discipline."  In recent days, the administration has searched for ways to compromise on the financing for the landmark bill, which would close or merge several hundred insolvent S&Ls.  The bill also would stiffen accounting and capital standards for S&Ls and put thrift regulators under the supervision of the Treasury.  Many in Congress were annoyed that Mr. Bush would threaten to kill or delay legislation he had called an "emergency" when it was proposed in February, and especially after most of his major provisions were preserved.  "The administration got at least 90% of what it wanted in this bill," said Rep. Chalmers Wylie (R., Ohio).  But the two financing plans didn't easily lend themselves to a compromise.  In the negotiations a week ago, several compromises were half-heartedly considered, and ultimately abandoned.  Most would have included half the spending on the federal budget, and half off the budget using industry bonds.  "Under the circumstances," Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) said late last night, "I think this is a good compromise."  A gain on stock acquired in an unsuccessful takeover effort boosted Coastal Corp.'s second-quarter net income 15%, but pretax operating profit fell about 5% because of weakness in its natural-gas pipeline business.  The energy concern also said it is considering selling or merging its trucking unit, which barely contributed to second-quarter net and has been a money-loser.  Coastal, of Houston, said net rose to $35.3 million, or 58 cents a share, from $30.6 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier.  But the results for the latest quarter included a $21 million after-tax gain from the sale of shares of Texas Eastern Corp. Coastal made a hostile bid for the company, which was eventually acquired by Panhandle Eastern Corp.  Revenue was $2.10 billion, up 13% from $1.86 billion.  Pretax operating profit fell to $147.7 million from $155.9 million.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Coastal shares fell 37.5 cents each to close at $43.125.  West Germany's industrial production recovered in June, rising an adjusted 2.3% from May and 1.6% from a year earlier, the Economics Ministry said in a preliminary report.  Industrial production in May was down a revised 4.5% from April, mainly because of an unusually large number of vacation days.  In June, production was boosted by construction activity, which rose almost 5%, and by the energy sector, where production gained 5.6%, the ministry said.  The figures are adjusted for inflation and seasonal factors.  Blue Circle PLC made a friendly offer for Myson Group PLC that values the maker of heating and air-conditioning products at #195.7 million ($325 million).  Myson last month accepted a lower offer from Yale & Valor PLC, a security and home-products group, but Myson said it has withdrawn its recommendation of that offer and intends to urge its shareholders to accept Blue Circle's bid.  "There is considerable commercial logic in putting Myson together with Blue Circle," said Myson's chairman, Ray Wheeler.  Blue Circle owns Armitage Shanks, Potterton and New World, all suppliers of bathroom, heating and kitchen products.  Part of Blue Circle's business strategy is to concentrate on and expand its core building-material and home-products operations in the U.S. and Europe, the company said.  Blue Circle hopes to purchase Myson to "broaden and strengthen" its product lines.  Perpetual Savings Bank said it plans to sell eight Virginia branch offices for a total of more than $160 million.  Perpetual said the sale will let the bank focus on retail-banking centers in the Washington area.  Potential buyers would include savings and commercial-banking institutions.  Banque Indosuez said the rescue of Al-Saudi Banque was completed with the takeover of the troubled bank by a new Banque Indosuez subsidiary.  The controversial rescue operation, put together by French authorities, followed the October collapse of Al-Saudi, a Paris-based bank owned by private Saudi investors, under more than two billion francs ($318.5 million) of bad loans.  Legent Corp., which develops and markets computer software, said it agreed to acquire closely held Business Software Technology Inc., Westborough, Mass., for newly issued stock valued at about $47 million.  Terms call for Legent, which already owns a 9.1% stake in Business Software, to issue 1,480,000 common shares for the remainder of the company.  Business Software has annual revenue of about $15 million.  Walgreen Co. said its July sales rose 11.3% to $438.4 million from $393.9 million a year earlier.  Comparable-store sales for the month rose 10.1%.  For the year to date, the drugstore concern said sales rose 10.7% to $3.08 billion from $2.78 billion a year earlier.  Walgreen operates 1,472 stores in 28 states and Puerto Rico.  Michaels Stores Inc. said July sales increased 16% to $23.4 million from $20.1 million a year ago.  Sales of the specialty crafts stores open more than a year increased about 8.5% to $21.8 million from $20.1 million.  Sales for the second quarter ended Sunday rose 18% to $57.5 million from $48.8 million.  Same store sales increased 11% to $53.9 million from $48.7 million.  Michaels said sales for the first six months increased 22% to $113.7 million from $92.9 million.  Same store sales increased 14% to $103.2 million from $90.3 million.  The world's international external debt has reached 1.3 trillion dollars, more than half owed by countries of Africa and Latin America, an Egyptian cabinet minister said.  Butros Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, spoke at the start of the fifth Symposium on Africa and Latin America, which meets annually, alternating between Cairo and Mexico City.  Mr. Ghali said Africa's share of that total was about $230 billion and Latin America's $440 billion dollars.  "These figures clearly demonstrate the magnitude of the problem facing our countries," he said.  Australian entrepreneur Ralph Sarich journeyed to the heartland of the U.S. auto industry to declare that his Orbital Engine Co. is within four years of putting its super-lightweight, two-stroke engines into Big Three production cars.  Mr. Sarich confirmed that Orbital will transform a shuttered General Motors Corp. parts plant in Tecuseh, Mich., into its first high-volume engine production facility.  The 250,000 engine-per-year plant is expected to cost about $250 million and start production in 1992, he said.  The 1.2-liter, three-cylinder Orbital engine has drawn interest in Detroit because auto makers are scrambling to develop lightweight, clean, high-mileage engines to meet tougher federal fuel economy and pollution standards.  Orbital says its two-stroke, three-cylinder engine produces 95 horsepower from a package half the size and weight of comparable four-stroke, four-cylinder engines in use today.  Because of weight savings, subcompact cars equipped with prototype, 90-pound Orbitals are getting as much as 50 miles to the gallon, said Mr. Sarich, managing director of Orbital's publicly traded parent company, Sarich Technologies Ltd. of Perth, Western Australia.  Orbital engines should meet federal emissions standards without some of the expensive exhaust scrubbing equipment now used, he said.  Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. have both purchased licenses to manufacture and sell engines using Orbital's computer-regulated, two-stroke combustion system.  Neither company has said they plan to design cars around the Orbital engine soon.  But Mr. Sarich said he expects they will by 1993 or 1994, provided the Orbital passes quality tests and federal emissions and fuel economy hurdles.  Orbital is developing a two-stroke V-6 engine aimed at the U.S. car market, he said.  Orbital's U.S. plant also will build engines for boats and industrial equipment, Mr. Sarich said.  Walter F. Greeley, chairman of High Street Associates, a Boston investment partnership, was named a director of this industrial and institutional products maker and mail-order concern, succeeding William S. Brewster, who resigned.  David R. Crichton, formerly president of Standex's precision-engineering division, was named executive vice president, operations, succeeding Sam G. Grillo, who died last month.  Ask Computer Systems Inc. said it agreed in principle to acquire closely held Data 3 Systems Inc., Santa Rosa, Calif., for $19 million.  Data 3, a maker of manufacturing software systems, has 115 employees and annual revenue of about $16 million.  Ask makes and markets management-information software systems and said the purchase of Data 3 is designed to expand its market opportunities.  Robert W. Bruce was elected to the board of this natural-resource exploration, mining, production and processing concern.  Mr. Bruce is president, chief investment officer and a director of Fireman's Fund Corp.  His appointment expands the board to 16 members.  Barclays PLC said pretax profit fell 8.1% in the first half because of provisions against Third World loans.  The results were announced a day after National Westminster Bank PLC, another of Britain's biggest banks, reported a 50% decline in pretax profit for the first half because of increased debt provisions.  Last week, Lloyds Bank PLC posted a 79% decline in first-half pretax profit, also because of debt provisions.  Barclays's profit before taxes fell to #590 million ($979.7 million) in the first half from #642 million a year earlier.  Barclays added #233 million to Third World debt provisions in the latest half, after making no addition to provisions in the year-earlier half.  The increase brought total provisions to #960 million, or 48% of Barclays's Third World debt exposure of #1.99 billion, up from 38% at the end of 1988.  Excluding the debt provisions, Barclays's pretax profit rose 28%, to #823 million.  The bank attributed this underlying increase to continued growth in domestic lending, expanded financial services, interest on proceeds from the bank's #921 million rights issue in May 1988, and an increase in interest-bearing deposits, which reduced the bank's need to raise money-market funds.  Profit attributable to shareholders, or net income, fell 2.9%, to #397 million from #409 million.  This publishing and printing concern named James Pfister, 42 years old, group vice president of information services for the Maxwell Macmillan communications and publishing group.  He succeeds Martin Maleska, 45, who was named vice president of corporate development for Maxwell Communication.  Mr. Pfister had been president of the National Register Publishing Co. unit of MacMillan Inc., a New York publishing and information-services company acquired by Maxwell Communication last year.  Management Co. Entertainment Group Inc. said it completed its acquisition of Virgin Vision Ltd., an independent international distributor of filmed entertainment, from London-based Virgin Group Ltd. in a transaction valued at $83 million.  The purchase price included $55 million in cash, $8 million of subordinated debt and 5.45 million MCEG common shares, or about a 22% stake.  MCEG is an entertainment concern with interests in talent management, production, distribution and marketing, and entertainment financing.  GenCorp Inc. said it sold its Mexican coated-fabrics subsidiary, Plasticos Laminados S.A., to Cydsa S.A., of Monterrey, Mexico.  Terms weren't disclosed.  Plasticos, which employs 250 workers at a plant north of Mexico City, makes polyurethane and vinyl-coated fabrics and films for footwear, luggage and the auto industry.  GenCorp serves the aerospace, automotive and related polymer-products markets.  This airline-holding company elected executive vice presidents Randall Malin and Seth E. Schofield to the newly created posts of vice chairmen of its board and that of its airline unit USAir.  The move follows the incorporation of Piedmont Airlines and PSA into USAir.  Mr. Malin will continue to serve the concern and the unit as executive vice president for marketing, and Mr. Schofield will do the same as executive vice president for operations.  Mr. Malin, 52 years old, and Mr. Schofield, 49, assumed their executive positions in May when they also joined Chairman and President Edwin I. Colodny in forming the newly created office of the chairman.  Their election increases the size of the two USAir boards to 15 from 13.  David Wellings, 48, was named to the new position of managing director, European confectionery, for this British soft drink and confectionery group.  Mr. Wellings was previously managing director of Cadbury Ltd., of which he now becomes chairman.  David Brooks, 55, Cadbury Ltd.'s operations director, succeeds Mr. Wellings as managing director.  Joseph E. Luecke, chairman of Kemper Corp., was elected to the board of this consumer and restaurant products concern.  Mr. Luecke's election aniticipates the retirement of several board members in May 1990 and increases the size of the board to 14 members.  Bobby Dillon, 59, president of Premark's decorative products group and of the firm's largest unit, Ralph Wilson Plastics Co., was elected a group vice president.  Gary L. Gamm, managing director of Peters Gamm & West, investment advisers in Wichita, and Donaldson B. Lee, a private investor from Birmingham, Ala., were named directors of this thrift.  Their appointments increase the board's membership to nine.  Lone Star Industries Inc. said it expects more claims by railroad customers charging that concrete rail ties made and sold by one of its units are faulty.  CSX Corp. recently sued the company over crumbling ties, after Lone Star refused to repair or replace them.  CSX, a Richmond, Va., holding company whose operations include railroad operation and maintenance, bought about 29,000 of the ties made after 1983 and is suing for $7.5 million.  Lone Star had promoted the concrete ties as superior to wooden ties because of their long life, CSX says.  Lone Star makes a variety of concrete products, and between 1983 and 1988 produced about 500,000 of the concrete ties, valued at about $30 million.  The ties made within that period are "suspect," Lone Star says.  Lone Star said Washington-based National Railroad Passenger Corp., or Amtrak, intends to hold Lone Star responsible for all expenses and damages it has incurred in remedying problems created by faulty ties.  Amtrak said it bought more than 300,000 of the concrete ties.  Lone Star, whose Lone Star Transportation Corp. unit produced the ties in Littleton, Mass., said it expects more claims for indemnification will be made against it.  Lone Star also said it will vigorously defend itself against any suit over the ties because it believes they met all contract specifications.  Lone Star added that it believes it has "substantial insurance coverage for such potential claims."  Chief financial officer Denis Maiorani was named to the additional and new post of senior vice president, finance and administration of this maker of communications equipment.  Mr. Maiorani, 41 years old, joined the company in 1983 and was elected senior vice president and chief financial officer last year.  Homer J. Livingston Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of H. Livingston & Co. and Livingston & Co. Southwest, was named a director of this utility, succeeding Millard Robbins, whose term expired.  BANKING ON DALEY: William M. Daley, a partner at Mayer, Brown & Platt, Chicago, is leaving the law firm to become vice chairman at Chicago sister banks Amalgamated Trust & Savings Bank and Oak Brook Bank.  The 41-year-old Mr. Daley, son of former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and younger brother of recently elected Mayor Richard M. Daley, said he will remain affiliated with the 480-lawyer firm in a non-partner position.  Since joining the firm in 1984, Mr. Daley has engaged in tax-related lobbying for corporate clients in Washington, D.C., and in Springfield, Ill.  Amalgamated Trust Executive Vice President Arthur Theriault said Mr. Daley will be primarily responsible for drumming up business in the government, labor and corporate markets.  "Obviously, I'll have to learn the business," said Mr. Daley, who has no banking experience.  He is a longtime friend of the banks' chairman, Eugene Haytow.  MAYER BROWN GETS ONE BACK: Roger J. Kiley, who recently retired from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., rejoined Mayer Brown as a partner.  Mr. Kiley, 52, will practice in the firm's litigation and government relations departments.  Mr. Kiley, a circuit court judge since 1976, was an associate with Mayer Brown from 1966 to 1968.  OTHER CAREER MOVES: Tower C. Snow Jr. and Jeffrey S. Facter, formerly partners with the San Francisco law firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, joined the New York firm of Shearman & Sterling as partners.  Mr. Snow, 41, and Mr. Facter, 36, are both litigators in the San Francisco office of the 550-lawyer firm. . . .  Michael A. Hertzberg, formerly a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the San Francisco firm of Graham & James, joined the Washington firm of Howrey & Simon as a partner.  Mr. Hertzberg, 45, specializes in international trade matters at the 140-lawyer firm.  Charles Busch has a new play, "The Lady in Question."  It's at the Orpheum, where, whatever else you may say about the proceedings, there's at least no wait for the ladies' room during intermission.  The only line is outside the men's -- Mr. Busch's tried and true fans, who've been supporting this master of camp farce since the beginning.  They're out in force, showing the flag as it were, even now that Mr. Busch's work has begun attracting straight as well as gay audiences.  At a press preview, this Busch claque was vociferously on hand to applaud the playwright/actor's signature grand entrance as a strong-faced man dressed as a strong-willed woman in a glorious, too-too-perfect outfit.  It was a typical scene out of his oeuvre, where beloved Hollywood cliches are rewritten and re-created with a distinctively homosexual flair.  Men play women, women play women; sometimes you forget who is playing whom and it really doesn't matter anyway.  With his "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom," still packing them in after five years at the Provincetown Playhouse, Mr. Busch's abundant charms have long since broken the sexuality barrier.  These days the seats for "Vampire Lesbians" are filled mainly with stray New Yorkers who haven't yet caught the show and heterosexual couples who drive in from New Jersey or the Island for a taste of something that sounds like wicked fun (and is, although perhaps not as much as it promises to be).  Word is out that Mr. Busch is telling the truth when he reveals to interviewers that "I'm about as avant-garde as Henny Youngman" (New York Post, 1987; New York Times, 1989).  "The Lady in Question," a sparkling spoof of several 1940s Nazi suspense films, chiefly Alfred Hitchcock's "Notorious," may seem a little lengthy for all but Mr. Busch's most impassioned fans.  Still, it offers enough slap-happy fun to satisfy any crossover audience looking for a goofy rendevous with destiny: Norma Shearer meets parodist drag queen.  Mr. Busch himself stars as Gertrude Garnet (like the gem), a classy, Shearerlike world famous concert pianist, risen from the lowbrow ranks of vaudeville where she was formerly known as Barrelhouse Gertie, the Kissing Kitten on the Keys.  When Miss Garnet (now pronounced Gar-nay, thank you) saunters into Nazi Germany, 1940, the most pressing question in her life is, "Where is my maid?"  Grandly outfitted in a blue mink-trimmed suit (with matching stole slung stylishly over her padded shoulders), Gertrude reeks of the worldliness of movie stars like Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead.  But Gertrude has a real aversion to the kind of heroism Ingrid Bergman practiced in "Casablanca" and "Notorious."  When an American professor named Erik Maxwell (Arnie Kolodner) tries to interest her in helping victims of the Nazis, she applies the helpfully self-serving philosophy of her personal swami.  "Perhaps all of these people who are being persecuted have chosen it," she mulls, thoughtfully stroking her mink.  But Gertrude soon finds out that carefree Bavaria is crawling with bad Germans who kill people whether they want to die or not.  A lovesick Nazi baron (Kenneth Elliott, the director and a long-time Busch collaborator) offers the dazzling Gertrude the use of his castle, even though his mother (Meghan Robinson) and sinister niece despise anyone who isn't of the master race, particularly red-haired statuesque international concert artists with loose morals.  Gertrude also meets some good Germans, like the brave and braided lass Heidi Mittelhoffer (Theresa Marlowe), who responds to a request that she join the female division of the Hitler Youth with: "I wouldn't play canasta with those goosestepping lezzies]"  Heidi might have been referring to the baron's evil little niece, Lotte Von Elsner, ferociously embodied by a pinafore-wearing Andy Halliday, who seems to have cross pollinated the little girl in "The Bad Seed" with Leopoldine Konstantin, Claude Rains's steel-faced Nazi-sympathizing mother in "Notorious."  While Gertrude zaps Lotte with some sterling zingers ("I do hope one day you'll realize, dear, that you have a special kind of beauty -- the kind that comes from within"), Lotte has the last word.  She kills Gertrude's best friend, Kitty (Julie Halston), and hangs her body conspicuously in the baron's front closet, where Gertrude dramatically uncovers it.  That's the last straw for Gertrude.  "It's as if the ribbon that held my world together untied," she says with a delicate quiver, checking out its dramatic effect on Prof.  Maxwell.  She joins him in the fight for right and risks her neck to rescue his wheelchair-bound ham-actress mother (Meghan Robinson again, looking and gloriously overemoting like Bette Davis in "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?") from Nazi clutches.  Though the pace may at times lag, in the end "The Lady in Question" explodes hilariously with Mr. Busch's particular love/hate relationship to movie cliches.  In the giddy 10 minutes of the finale the playwright drags on to the stage just about every 1940s-style Hollywood myth about good and evil and male and female behavior, and the company responds with impeccable comic precision.  Mr. Busch shows a remarkable comic range within the enclosed world of Hollywood movie star homage.  He's a devastating parodist-whether exuding a Ginger Rogers self-made American toughness or a Katharine Hepburn aloof elegance.  His transformations are invaluably aided by the costume designers, Robert Locke and Jennifer Arnold, who concoct everything from smart and sporty jodhpurs to a concert artist's white-and-gold lame gown with the right light satiric touch.  They leave it to Mr. Busch to make the joke soar, and he does.  And so a heroine is born, and, thanks to Mr. Busch and company, another step is taken in dismantling the cliches of nobility and sexuality long propagated by popular culture.  It is Mr. Busch's particular talent to dismantle cliches in so good natured and endearingly theatrical a fashion.  Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) was angry last month when Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, refused to attend his hearing on the Bush administration's clean-air proposals.  Mr. Boskin was cited by Mr. Waxman as one of three administration officials outside of the Environmental Protection Agency who "had an enormous impact on this legislation. . . .  We need the decision-makers who worked for months behind closed doors to share their thinking with us."  The unusual rebuke was testimony to the new stature of the Council of Economic Advisers in Washington.  During the Reagan years, the council was a sleepy backwater, seldom consulted, usually ignored.  But in the past six months, Mr. Boskin has changed that.  He has made his mark not only on the clean-air proposals but also on administration trade policy.  And he's become a key link in White House relations with the Federal Reserve.  "Boskin has done a great job," says White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.  "And not just on the academics of economic theory.  He's been right there, involved in the details of policy."  A former Stanford University professor, Mr. Boskin was a leader among the economists who in the 1970s began criticizing the effects of government policies on economic incentives.  His work on taxes led some to label him a "supply-sider"; but he distanced himself from others in the supply-side movement by focusing on the harmful effects of budget deficits and by arguing that the 1981 tax cut was partly to blame.  "I've always thought of myself as a moderate," he now says.  Unlike some of his predecessors, the White House economist has also demonstrated a willingness to bend to political necessity.  He agreed earlier this year, for instance, to sign on to an interest-rate forecast that most private economists thought was wildly optimistic.  That stood in sharp contrast to the actions of former Reagan economist Martin Feldstein, also a distinguished academic, who argued vehemently against a rosy forecast in 1982, in part to preserve his academic credibility. (In the end, Mr. Feldstein's forecast proved excessively pessimistic.)  Mr. Boskin's willingness to help forge compromises was demonstrated in the recent debate over voluntary steel-import quotas.  Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Trade Representative Carla Hills pushed for a four-year extension of quotas, while Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady asked for only two years.  Mr. Boskin proposed the successful compromise of 2 1/2 years, arguing that that timetable would keep the quotas intact until after the 1991 congressional debate on the Uruguay Round trade proposals, but would end them before the 1992 presidential campaign.  Established in 1946, the Council of Economic Advisers has always held an awkward spot in the White House policy apparatus.  It has few operational responsibilities; its only real role is to provide the president with advice.  And if the president isn't interested in that advice, the council withers -- as it did through much of the Reagan years.  In a paper written last year, White House domestic-policy adviser Roger Porter argued that historically, the council's influence has been strongest when the economy is in crisis or when the council chairman has an unusually close relationship with the president.  With no economic crisis in sight, Mr. Boskin has had to use his intellectual and personal skills to forge a relationship with President Bush, whom he barely knew before the Bush campaign last year.  Now, the economist speaks to Mr. Bush regularly and is an occasional tennis companion on weekends.  Some White House watchers say Mr. Boskin enjoys the closest relations with the president of any council chairman since Alan Greenspan served with President Ford in the early 1970s.  "Bush has a style where he likes to relate to people as individuals," says one administration official, "and he happens to like Boskin."  Mr. Boskin's influence in the administration has been particularly evident on trade issues, where he has pushed policies to preserve and promote free trade.  In addition to fighting to cut back steel quotas, he also worked to trim the list of countries and practices cited for questionable trading practices under the so-called "Super 301" provisions of the trade law.  On the administration's clean-air proposals, Mr. Boskin helped design a regulatory policy that achieved the goal of reducing pollution while at the same time minimizing the cost to the economy.  "It used to be conventional wisdom among economists that there was no constituency for economic efficiency in government," says Dan Dudek, senior economist with the Environmental Defense Fund.  "With the resurgence of the Council of Economic Advisers, that's no longer true.  The development of systematic and economically rational policies has been given a voice, and I'd say a very strong voice, in the administration."  Mr. Boskin's new influence has also helped energize the council's staff.  "Boskin has the kind of access to the president that really makes a big difference," says Steve Landefeld, who has worked as a special assistant to both Mr. Boskin and his predecessor, Beryl Sprinkel.  "Certainly I'm aware of that difference, and a lot of the staffers see it as well."  At 43 years of age, Mr. Boskin is one of the youngest members of the president's team.  He earned his doctorate at the age of 24, and by his early 30s, he was widely recognized as one of the leading lights in the economic field.  As a student and teacher at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s, Mr. Boskin acknowledges, he was caught up in the liberal tide of social, cultural and political change that swept across that campus.  But the failed economic policies of the 1970s led him to become increasingly skeptical of government solutions to problems.  "I don't think I changed my basic values," he says.  "I just learned from the government's experience."  Mr. Boskin's first involvement in politics came in 1980, when he joined a Reagan advisory panel.  He was offered jobs in the Reagan administration in 1981, 1985 and 1986, but each time he declined for personal reasons.  When the Bush campaign got under way, the vice president's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, called Mr. Boskin and asked that he get more involved.  That led to a heavy involvement in the campaign, and ultimately to an offer to become chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  He moved here in January with his wife, Chris, who now works as director of publishing services for Hearst Magazines in New York.  As a newcomer to government, Mr. Boskin has sometimes suffered from his inexperience.  His efforts to educate the White House press corps with brief lectures on economics, for instance, have resulted in hoots of derision.  Nevertheless, colleagues praise the economist for quickly learning the ways of Washington.  "I see the council as having almost gone out of existence" during the Reagan years, says George Eads, chief economist at General Motors Corp. and a member of the council during the Carter administration.  "Everything I hear is that it's beginning to be a force in policy making again."  John McPhee's new book, "The Control of Nature" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 272 pages, $17.95), is about engineers trying to keep liquids from flowing downhill.  They shore up the banks of the Mississippi River to prevent the water from carving a disastrous new channel.  They spray sea water on an Icelandic lava flow to harden it before it oozes through a fishing harbor.  And they build stadium-sized basins to capture the muddy debris that slurps down the San Gabriel mountains near Los Angeles, sweeping along cars, houses and sometimes people.  The title is ironic.  No matter how imaginative, shrewd, tireless and well-financed the engineers may be, and no matter how assertively they spout their confidence, it's likely that in the end these liquid masses will find gravity more compelling than any contrivances of man.  Mr. McPhee is a writer's writer -- a master craftsman whom many aspirants study -- now famous and long ensconced at the New Yorker magazine, where "The Control of Nature" first appeared.  For one thing, he has an engaging, distinctive voice.  It is warm, understated and wry.  Within a paragraph or two, he takes us into his company and makes us feel we're on an outing with an old chum.  A talky old chum, to be sure, with an occasional tendency to corniness and rambling, but a cherished one nevertheless.  And Mr. McPhee is the envy of other writers for his ability to follow wherever his fancy leads.  He has pulled off whole books, for example, about oranges, his Scottish ancestors, birch-bark canoes and a tail-less airplane.  We read his books not so much because we're thirsty for information about canoes, but because it's worth tagging along on any literary journey Mr. McPhee feels like taking.  Lately, however, our old friend has been straining his luck with a series of books about the earth sciences: Even a master can breathe only so much life into plate tectonics.  So it was dismaying to learn that in his new book Mr. McPhee is still stuck in the rock pile.  "The Control of Nature" may be about water, lava and mud, but it grows from the author's seemingly deep and eternal wonderment with geological lore.  Fortunately, though, the three stories are genuinely interesting, with lots of pleasantly eccentric people and a minimum of talky scientists.  Over time the Mississippi River carries silt from upstream and deposits it near the mouth.  The silt extends the river and makes it shallower, until it spills over its banks and begins to cut a new channel.  This process, repeated since prehistoric time, created most of the state of Louisiana.  But it can't be allowed to continue, or New Orleans and Baton Rouge will be left low and dry along with the industrial complexes that line the current channel.  The biggest threat is the Atchafalaya River, which once merely swung near the Mississippi 300 miles north of New Orleans.  Years ago, the Mississippi jumped the gap, and the Atchafalaya became a distributary.  A thirsty distributary at that, for each year it took more water from the big river, threatening to swallow it whole.  At that point, the Army Corps of Engineers declared war.  Today a reinforced-concrete navigation lock governs the flow into the Atchafalaya, but the Mississippi is already nibbling at its underpinnings.  While the Corps voices confidence, other scientists say the river will ultimately make its own path.  In Iceland, what's flowing out of control isn't water but lava.  Mr. McPhee reconstructs the 1973 volcanic eruption on Heimaey, an island off the south coast, that rained rock and ash on a town and harbor for 5 1/2 months.  And instead of Army engineers, the battle was led by an assistant harbor master with an idea that struck the entire nation as absurd: Squirt water on the lava to harden it before it reached the town or harbor.  The massive hosing did indeed stop the early flow.  Then, as the eruption continued, the cooled lava barrier actually diverted a new flow right into town, burying 200 buildings.  But since the lava narrowed and improved the harbor mouth, the episode is recalled as a triumph.  The fluid that flows so disastrously in Los Angeles is a slurry of muddy debris, including boulders the size of automobiles, from the upper reaches of the San Gabriel Mountains.  When conditions are right, the debris breaks loose and thunders down the mountainside, wiping out everything in its path.  But wealthy people enjoy the views and the cool breezes, so they continue to build houses on the slopes.  As a result, the county has had to build and maintain -- at enormous taxpayer expense -- huge structures high above the houses to capture the debris.  But these basins are useless unless they are emptied as soon as they fill, and in any case there aren't enough basins to protect every house in every canyon.  Of the three stories, this one cries most loudly of arrogance and futility.  From the opening anecdote, which describes the author unfurling one of his trademark bandannas, the book is unmistakable McPhee: the silky narrative with keen detail and sharp dialogue, the finely drawn characters, the nimble metaphors, easy pace and meandering but skillful organization.  The act may be getting familiar, but it hasn't lost much of its allure.  One suggestion for later editions: Some visual aids would help.  The relationship of the Mississippi, the Atchafalaya and the Corps of Engineers' locks and dikes, for example, is incomprehensible without a map.  --- Mr. MacDonald observes nature in Ulster County, N.Y.  If music soothes the savage breast, can it also charm a holed-up gunman?  Nobody is exactly sure.  But the Houston Police Department has discovered it will usually do something.  So this city's hostage-negotiating team has made music -- and sometimes more-ordinary noise -- one of its secret weapons.  During standoffs over the past three years, everything from soothing gospel tunes to rousing martial airs have blared from the team's state-of-the-art mobile command post.  Not long ago, police found themselves squared off against an 18-year-old who ended an all-night drinking binge by threatening to commit suicide.  His 5 a.m. burst of random gunfire made police fear for the safety of his mother, who was with him.  So they decided to wait.  After six hours, they figured that he was probably not only tired but also suffering one humdinger of a hangover.  They figured right.  The police played "Stars and Stripes Forever" at a deafening decibel level over their loudspeakers, and the previously belligerent teen promptly changed his tune.  He surrendered unarmed -- and wincing.  It's impossible to credit the use of a recording alone for a surrender, says Sgt. Royce Wells, a veteran negotiator.  "But I'm sure it helps make them more aware of what's going on."  Sgt. Wells says sound effects -- breaking glass, cats fighting or sirens -- may be played if children are at risk.  The strategy is to stir the children's fears so they'll pressure their captor into reasoning with the police.  Sometimes music simply breaks the ice, says Greg Riede, director of psychological services for the Houston police.  "Meaningful dialogue isn't always an option, like in the movies," he says.  Dr. Riede explains that if it's known that someone felt happiest when in the Army, for instance, police might play something patriotic.  A gospel classic, such as "How Great Thou Art," might be played in hopes of hitting a spiritual soft spot.  The job of picking just the right tune falls to Deputy Chief W.H. Gaines, who decides which of the team's 100-selection repertoire will be played.  But he won't elaborate on that; publicity about the team's musical prowess strikes a sour note around police headquarters.

The behind-the-scenes jockeying over who will be Japan's next ruling-party president and prime minister has produced a new front-runner, 58-year-old former Education Minister Toshiki Kaifu.  Mr. Kaifu is little known outside Japan and hasn't held any of the top jobs in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party or any of the main cabinet portfolios in economic and foreign policy.  His main qualifications seem to be that he's a fresh face with few major enemies in the LDP and no known scandals in his background.  LDP members of the Diet, or parliament, are scheduled to elect their new president Tuesday, and other candidates could still emerge before the candidacy-declaration deadline Saturday.  But everything seemed to be jelling for Mr. Kaifu yesterday when his faction leader and principal rival, 78-year-old Toshio Komoto, announced that he was withdrawing from the race.  Mr. Komoto said his faction would support Mr. Kaifu.  Significantly, Mr. Komoto made the decision to withdraw after conferring with such party elders as former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and former party secretary general Shintaro Abe.  The clear suggestion was that they had decided to throw the support of their powerful LDP factions behind Mr. Kaifu.  Tsutomu Hata, a Takeshita-faction Diet member and former agriculture minister, said in a television interview that Mr. Kaifu is "the type of person who crosses factional lines," meaning that he could be supported by members of other factions.  Mr. Kaifu is young enough to please those in the beleaguered LDP who think only a fresh face can restore the party's public popularity in the wake of so many recent scandals and policy blunders.  But his 10 terms in the Diet's lower house make him senior enough to please those interested in preserving party traditions.  Mr. Kaifu's boyish good looks and rhetorical eloquence would serve him well on television, an increasingly important consideration as the LDP may soon have to campaign for lower-house elections against the charismatic Socialist leader Takako Doi.  At the same time, he apparently doesn't represent a threat to his peers in the party, as did a previous younger front-runner, 52-year-old Ryutaro Hashimoto.  What is less clear is what Mr. Kaifu stands for, if anything, and whether he would have the experience or political acumen to pull off any agenda he came up with.  An aide to one Diet member predicted his rule would be "weak."  Mr. Kaifu's image as a relatively clean political reformer suffered when he announced yesterday, in declaring his candidacy, that he had accepted 15 million yen ($110,000) in political contributions over five years from Recruit Co., which was at the center of the biggest recent scandal.  But Mr. Kaifu may have minimized that problem by making a clean breast of it.  He said the contributions were routine, legal and reported as required by law.  He said he didn't accept any contributions from the company after the first revelations last summer about the company's widespread efforts to buy influence by giving politicians shares of a subsidiary.  Shizuka Kamei, the leader of a group of younger right-wing LDP politicians who have been calling for party reform, applauded Mr. Kaifu's candidacy, calling it "welcome."  But he expressed the hope that others also would declare, so that the decision could be made by a meaningful vote.  He and others suggested that the selection of Mr. Kaifu purely through jockeying among the LDP's factions would add to the party's negative image as undemocratic and out of touch with reality.  One hopeful who may yet declare his candidacy is Shintaro Ishihara, a novelist and former transportation minister who is popular among conservative LDP members.  The current prime minister, Sosuke Uno, announced his resignation after the party lost its majority in the Diet's upper house in nationwide elections two weeks ago.  Mr. Uno was selected just two months ago, in part because he was thought to be free of scandal, but then came revelations of his involvement with a geisha.  Those revelations, along with the Recruit scandal, a recently enacted 3% consumption tax, agricultural liberalization and the LDP's arrogant image were the main factors in the party's upper-house defeat.  Many party leaders fear the LDP could lose its crucial lower-house majority in elections sometime during the next year if the party doesn't select its leader wisely.  UNITED TELEVISION Inc., Los Angeles, said it is calling for redemption on Sept. 1 of all $49.9 million outstanding of its 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due Dec. 15, 2000.

The company, which operates four TV stations, also said it received about $139 million as part of Time Inc.'s tender offer for Warner Communications Inc. common shares.  About 1,988,000 of the Warner shares that United Television owned were sold, leaving it with a Warner holding of 1,493,000 shares.  Premark International Inc. is putting its Precor physical-fitness equipment business up for sale.

Batts, Premark chairman and chief executive officer.  Goldman, Sachs & Co. will handle the sale.  No other details were announced.  Precor employs 250 people.  In a move that could spur airline mergers, the European Community Commission said member countries can't restrict ownership in carriers by companies from other EC nations.  Karel Van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, yesterday was authorized to "remind" the 12 governments that national limits on foreign investment of airlines is illegal within the 12 nations.  "This has always been the law," said a spokesman for Mr. Van Miert, "but it wasn't being applied to airlines."  In current practice, only an airline majority-owned by national investors can establish itself and gain traffic rights out of that country.  The maximum foreign shareholding now allowed varies between 25% and 49%, depending on the country.  But the EC is saying that those limits shouldn't apply to other EC investors.  The commission said yesterday this is essential to the creation of a true internal market in aviation after 1992.  It also said that countries outside the EC should treat equally EC airlines that are majority-owned by EC nationals.  If enforced, this boost to the so-called right of establishment could encourage cross-border mergers and investments and the establishment of new airlines in the 12 nations.  These national limits have been used to thwart ambitions.  Scandinavian Airlines System, considered an EC carrier by dint of its Danish shareholding (Sweden and Norway aren't EC members), two years ago tried to buy 40% of British Caledonian Airways.  But British law limited SAS to a 25% stake.  British Airways, the initial bidder, ultimately bought British Caledonian.  Air Europe, a British airline group, has been assembling a network of European carriers in recent months by buying the maximum allowable minority stake in each new carrier.  Now it looks as though Air Europe could dispense with the local owners, if it chose, and start up or buy a carrier outright.  "If this {edict} is enforced, it will make things very interesting," said an Air Europe spokeswoman.  Separately, the EC Commission, at its last meeting before the summer break, failed to answer a complaint brought by Union de Transports Aeriens, an independent French carrier.  UTA last month threatened to take the commission to the European Court of Justice for failure to act on the complaint.  Airline officials yesterday weren't available to comment on their next step.  EC officials would only say that the matter is expected to go on the commission's agenda in mid-September.  As reported, UTA seven months ago filed a complaint with Brussels claiming that the French government discriminated against it by withholding traffic rights in Europe.  Yesterday's decree on right of establishment could boost UTA's case, as could an EC proposal that states not be allowed to refuse traffic rights if their airlines meet the necessary financial and technical standards to fly.  Your July 24 editorial "Risk the Moon" clearly points out this nation's need to be willing to take "great risks for great rewards" in space.  I just would like to add that Spain was the third country Christopher Columbus had to approach before he could get support for his explorations.  A nation that is willing to continue the business of exploration can always be found.  However, as President John F. Kennedy pointed out on Sept. 12, 1962, "The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join or not.  It is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space."  Thomas A. Lash  Colorado Springs, Colo.  Siemens AG of West Germany and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC are expected to revive their long-stalled takeover bid for British rival Plessey Co., having removed the last British government obstacle.  After weeks of negotiations, the two bidders cleared their breakup plans for Plessey with the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense, Plessey's biggest customer.  As a condition of its approval, the ministry imposed terms safeguarding Plessey's military secrets and defense contracts if the bid succeeds.  Senior executives of Siemens and its British bidding partner, which is known as GEC, are scheduled to meet here today to map their strategy.  Sources close to the companies said they're likely to renew their bid but must decide how soon and at what price.  Their original offer, unveiled Nov. 16 but delayed by government negotiations, valued Plessey at #1.7 billion ($2.82 billion), or 225 pence ($3.74) a share.  London analysts expect a revised bid within days approaching #2.1 billion, or 275 pence a share, but the companies have 21 days to decide under British bidding rules.  In London trading yesterday, Plessey shares rose five pence each, to 276 pence.  Spokesmen for Siemens and GEC, which is unrelated to U.S.-based General Electric Co., declined to discuss their companies' plans.  A Plessey spokesman said his company's holders would benefit more from an independent Plessey than from one "dismembered" by its rivals.  But Plessey now appears to have little chance of escaping GEC and Siemens.  Plessey's "only defense is to persuade shareholders" that its stock is worth more than GEC and Siemens offer, said the fund manager at one of Plessey's major institutional investors.  "I think they're {Plessey} going to have a lot of difficulty doing that," added the fund manager, who declined to be identified.  London financial analysts agreed.  "GEC and Siemens can dictate, to a large extent, the way things are going to go" because Plessey has few defenses left, said London-based analyst Richard Johnson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.  The pact between the bidders and Britain's defense ministry breaks new ground in Europe's defense business.  Foreign takeovers of European defense contractors are seldom allowed, but lately the region's defense ministries have been encouraging cross-border collaboration in weapons-building to save money.  The Plessey saga indicates that, at least in Britain, a foreign bidder can sometimes benefit from that more-liberal climate to squeeze past normally protective defense ministries.  Though other European defense contractors would have a political edge in Britain, many U.S. contractors also are eager to try their luck.  Recently, the stocks of several British defense contractors have risen on bid speculation.  "In principle, there's nothing to prevent foreign companies from buying U.K. defense contractors," said GEC's legal director, Michael Lester, who led his company's team in the ministry talks.  Still, he added, "any foreign buyer would have to give a number of undertakings" to satisfy the ministry.  Indeed, the November joint bid by GEC and Siemens, part of an industry trend toward consolidation, snagged repeatedly on Plessey's defense tactics and on political obstacles.  British officials fretted that Plessey's military secrets might leak out through Siemens, Europe's largest electronics concern.  They also feared that GEC, the Defense Ministry's biggest electronics supplier, might gain a near-monopoly over that segment of ministry procurement if it got control of Plessey.  Yesterday's agreement with the ministry is intended to ease those fears.  Though more restrictive than GEC officials originally expected, it had few surprises.  The most important conditions require Siemens and GEC to split up Plessey's defense businesses to maintain competition on key electronics contracts.  Thus, GEC would get Plessey's avionics, naval electronics and cryptographics units.  Siemens would get its radar and military communications businesses.  Moreover, to protect British military secrets, the top executives of all the Plessey defense businesses must be British citizens.  One unexpected clause hints at possible further links between GEC and Siemens.  The pact specifies that the ministry won't object if GEC ever decides to buy as much as 5% of Siemens's voting shares.  GEC's Mr. Lester said his company hasn't "any plans at all" to buy Siemens stock, and that the clause was added merely to avoid foreclosing any possibilities.  Audi of America Inc. said it is extending its lease-incentive program for Audi cars through Sept. 30.

When China's leaders denounce "bourgeois liberals," we Libertarians cheerfully can admit to being experts on the subject.  "Bourgeois liberalism" is our stock in trade.  Like the students and other protesters in China, we favor free speech, a free press, freedom of intellectual life, free markets, and democratic and constitutional checks on government.  We Libertarians want to see these things in China, the U.S. and throughout the world.  In the words of China's most prominent dissident, Fang Lizhi, "freedom of speech means the same thing everywhere."  And, like the Chinese, we Libertarians see the corruption that results when a privileged and politically powerful elite dictates the course of economic life.  What should individuals do who sympathize with the Chinese people?  What should the American government do?  Individuals should donate to refugee-relief groups, to Amnesty International, in order to help political prisoners, and to Chinese student and community groups in America that have links to those suffering in China.  The U.S. government should end permanently its military ties with China.  Not only are these ties a present-day embarrassment, they easily can embroil America in overseas troubles in the future.  Congress should repeal the Neutrality statutes that block private Americans from aiding the anti-government resistance in China.  The people of China have stood up and said: "Give me liberty or give me death."  The Chinese government has responded by dealing out death and arrests to thousands, but it cannot rub out the Chinese people's yearning for liberty.  David K.

At a time when the U.S. is so critical of China for rewriting history concerning events at Tiananmen Square, I note the following in the Centennial Edition of The Wall Street Journal:  "1890 -- At Wounded Knee, S.D., Indians and U.S. Troops fight the last major battle of the Indian Wars."  I was disappointed that you did not report that event correctly.  Anyone with even rudimentary knowledge of that period of our history knows that the so-called Battle of Wounded Knee was a massacre of mostly unarmed men, women and children.  The well-armed troopers even resorted to the use of Hotchkiss artillery located above the camp.  The number of Indians killed was estimated at 300 of a total of 350.  Trooper casualties numbered 25 -- mostly killed by stray bullets from their own rifles or shrapnel from the artillery.  It occurs to me that before we become too self-righteous, it is important to remember that the U.S. has done its share of rewriting history.  William V. Ackerman  Upton, Wyo.  The Japanese government apparently is seeking to discourage auto makers from building too many plants and production lines in Japan, fearing a new export surge and renewed trade tensions.  Many auto makers here are expanding domestic capacity as they scramble to catch up with a general consumption boom.  Auto sales in Japan rose 12% last year, and workers at auto plants are being forced to work weekends and shorten summer vacations.  But the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, worries that when Japan's car consumption eventually starts cooling, makers with excess capacity may be encouraged to start shipping the cars abroad.  "Our biggest fear is a rapid rise in exports to the U.S. and Europe," says an auto official at MITI.  Japanese auto exports now are limited by so-called voluntary quotas.  But the MITI official said those agreements are informal and may not be able to limit sales in the future.  Analysts say MITI is mainly concerned about the tendency of Japanese companies to follow their rivals in planning production, regardless of their sales estimates.  "If companies start competing to expand capacity, that will be a problem," says Nobuyoshi Yoshida, president of Japan's Automotive Business Practice Institute Inc.  The nation's auto makers already are stirring tensions abroad by rapidly expanding production capacity in Europe and the U.S., while companies based in those countries are losing sales.  Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have announced plans to build factories in Britain to establish a European presence before the integration of European Community markets in 1992.  Honda, as well as Nissan Motor Co., also is significantly expanding capacity in the U.S. MITI officials contend they have no power to enforce capacity restrictions on the companies.  But the government, known for its strong, though informal, influence over Japanese industry, intends to get the message across in a hearing with auto makers in September.  Despite the government's concerns, however, Japanese companies say that, for the time being at least, they have no intention of trimming expansion plans.  "Our responsibility is to provide the products to the customers," says Honda spokesman Shigeaki Kato.  Honda added a production line this year, hoping to boost domestic sales 10%, to 685,000 vehicles.  And with another plant opening next year, the company aims to sell 800,000 vehicles annually in Japan in several years.  Toyota, whose sales reached 2.1 million units in 1988, is adding assembly lines this year to increase its annual production capacity by 180,000 units.  Mazda Motor Corp. aims to double domestic sales in five years, to 800,000 cars, but denies rumors that a new large-scale production plant is planned.  Japanese auto makers sold 6.7 million cars domestically last year and exported 6.1 million cars.  The British government intends to write off nearly all debt owed by the country's water authorities and endow them with a #1 billion ($1.66 billion) environmental cleanup fund before their privatization later this year, an Environment Ministry official said.  Michael Howard, minister for water, also said the authorities will face a ceiling on annual inflation-adjusted rate increases of "just under 5%" on average for the first five years after privatization.  The debt write-off and environmental fund are intended to cushion the costs of capital investment the nine companies need to make to meet European Community standards.  Both measures were anticipated and considered necessary by analysts to ensure the successful sale of the authorities in a flotation scheduled to begin in November.  The government is expected to raise between #5 billion and #7 billion from the sale of the authorities.  Daimler-Benz AG received a qualified approval of its planned takeover of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. but may have to sell some assets to gain the West German government's full assent.  The Monopoly Commission, a panel of antitrust experts who are regularly asked to supply non-binding advice to the Economics Ministry on antitrust matters, urged the government to set certain asset sales as conditions before approving the takeover.  Those assets are mainly in defense technology.  It also criticized the Bonn government's role in promising financial aid for the merger of the companies, which would command over half of West Germany's defense industry and create Europe's second-largest aerospace group after British Aerospace PLC.  Shares of the Daimler-Benz group jumped on the report as investors ignored the commission's caveats and focused on its approval, a strong indication that Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann will approve the merger.  Daimler-Benz's own shares shot up 16 marks yesterday to close at 806 marks ($435).  Shares of its AEG AG electronics subsidiary rose 9.80 marks to 217.80.  The commission's approval removed a major obstacle to the merger.  But the appended conditions complicate the position of Mr. Haussmann, who is to decide next month whether to override the Federal Cartel Office, which rejected the merger in April.  Previously, Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter warned that setting conditions on the merger could cause the deal to fall through.  Yesterday, the company called the panel's conditions unacceptable.  Adding to the controversy, the Monopoly Commission's chairman, Ulrich Immenga, resigned to protest his panel's approval.  Mr. Immenga, the panel's only dissenter, asserted that the Daimler-MBB combination would dominate the market in aerospace and defense technology in West Germany and have undue political influence in Bonn.  Daimler-Benz's planned 1.7 billion-mark ($917.4 million) purchase of the state-owned MBB group would create an automotive, high technology and defense conglomerate with annual sales approaching 80 billion marks ($43.2 billion), ranking it among the world's leading aerospace and defense concerns.  It's summer stock time in Washington, with one of the oldest numbers in the repertory playing to packed audiences.  The name of the drama?  That staple of Republicans and Democrats alike: "Can This Weapon System Be Saved?"  You'd think the crowd would be a little less caught up in the excitement, given the number of times the old chestnut has been on the boards.  But I'm going to kill the suspense.  Yes, the B-2 Stealth bomber will eventually be funded and yes, the cost per plane will be even higher than the current estimates of $550 million and yes, it won't have a mission that would justify even a tenth of the cost.  The reason it will go into full production, though probably with fewer than the 132 planes currently sought, is the same reason other redundant military requests were approved in the face of common sense and negative cost analyses.  It's there, the Russians don't have it and a lot of congressional districts do.  But as with all old-fashioned dramas, the heroine (a k a Stealth) will be tied to the tracks several times, only to be saved at the last minute on each occasion.  Congressional critics will push full throttle, hoping for a clean hit, but a majority of their peers will pull them away and hit the brakes.  Stealth is too young to die, too expensive to kill, too valuable as a bargaining chip; Stealth is the weapon we've always yearned for.  That is, one that can allegedly pinpoint and obliterate a terrorists' nest, one that can menace an entire nation and one that can locate and blow away a mobile missile deep in enemy territory -- and then return home without a scratch.  In other words, Stealth is everything that was ever promised and never delivered by each new turn of the arms race.  And like all those other "breakthroughs"' which, we were told, the Russians could never counter or match, the biggest selling point is that Stealth is a masterpiece of American technology.  It has a "profile" that can't be read by radar, and as far as we can tell, the Russians won't have the capacity to do so for a long time.  We have it, they don't ergo, we should deploy it.  Of course, the points made to support Stealth have changed radically.  When the Carter administration launched it, the assumption was that a new, untouchable weapon was needed to replace our nuclear submarines, which we had convinced ourselves would soon be vulnerable.  But the sea is as opaque today as it was 10 years ago, our submarines are still virtually impossible to detect and some of their missiles now have the pinpoint accuracy of land-launched ICBMs.  But then, it was and is argued -- as on the Journal's editorial page last week -- that Stealth is needed to render the Soviet Union's $250 billion air defense system obsolete.  As matters now stand, some claim, our bombers can no longer function as a mission-capable leg of the triad of air, land and sea-launched retaliation.  But it has long been clear, and part of Air Force doctrine, that B-52 and B-1 bombers armed with cruise missiles would in time of war simply stand off the Soviet coast and fire away, piercing the Russians air defense system at will.  The fact that the Soviet Union has been dumb enough to pour billions of dollars into countering yesterday's threat does not justify our returning the compliment.  Cruise missiles have already turned their expensive defenses into today's version of the Maginot Line.  Finally, Stealth is offered as the ultimate weapon in non-nuclear conflicts, the shield behind which we can wield our limited-conflict rapiers with impunity.  References are often made to Libya, but presumably the same reasoning would apply to the takeout of Latin drug lords and recalcitrant Third World Marxists.  It's an inspiring conceit, lifted from comic books and old notions of "surgical strikes."  What renders it unfortunately unbelievable is the dismal record of air power in such circumstances in our recent past.  But if the case against Stealth seems compelling to some of us, the Air Force's fanatical determination to preserve a place for the manned bomber in strategic warfare is equally compelling to many others.  So, too, are those glossy magazine ads and slick television commercials, paid for by defense contractors, selling Stealth like the Mercedes of Armageddon.  Let there be no doubt that the Mercedes analogy is apt.  Today's price tag is $70.2 billion for 132 planes.  Since Stealth has been a "black" project, we don't know what the old projections were, but the history of the B-1s costs are probably instructive.  In 1981 the B-1 was supposed to cost $11.1 billion.  It escalated to $18 billion, then $39 billion before Congress called a halt.  Production was cut to 100 aircraft at a cost of $27 billion -- assuming that particular turkey has no more major problems.  It's only reasonable to assume that $70 billion will be more like $100 billion before all the bugs are ironed out of the B-2, which has yet to face severe flight testing.  Either way, we're talking about big money.  That low-ball $70 billion would pay for the following: the 100 B-1 bombers, 255 mobile MX "Peacekeepers" and 13 Trident subs.  There are defense experts who believe that such a triad, all alone, would make for a credible deterrent.  But Stealth is the bright wonder weapon of the moment, and so Stealth we will have.  That's the way the play always comes out, and lousy though the script may be, it always brings the audience to its feet, saluting.  ---  Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm.  Once again, Tokyo's giant stock market is confounding convention.  Times of national turmoil generally roil a country's financial markets.  In Japan, though, stock prices have been leaping from all-time high to all-time high since the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party was thrown into chaos by a stunning electoral upset July 23.  It has happened before: The market recorded similar gains during another crisis this year, when Emperor Hirohito died Jan. 7 after a long illness.  Now, as then, the market's winning tonic is a combination of strong economic fundamentals and a deep sense of relief that a looming market hazard is out in the open and, investors hope, out of the way.  Going into the election, the Tokyo market had been hampered by a year of political scandals and upheaval, tinged with fears that a severe election setback for the Liberal Democrats might crimp Japan's 32-month economic expansion.  In the first six months of the year, the Nikkei average, an index of 225 key stocks, was up only 9.2%, compared with a 28.8% gain in 1988's first half.  But in the eight trading days since the election, the Tokyo market has soared.  Even though the Nikkei index rose only 0.88 points yesterday to close at 34899.34, it has climbed nearly 3% from its pre-election level.  On Monday, in fact, the index closed at a record 34953.87 and at one point yesterday stood above 35000.  "We didn't expect such a very, very strong market," says Tokyo-based Shoji Yamada, a general manager at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co., which manages more than $40 billion.  "What Japanese investors hate most is uncertainty," says Hiroshi Ikeuchi, a vice president at Nomura Securities Co. in New York.  And the July 23 election removed any doubts about whether the Liberal Democrats would lose.  Without such worries, Japanese analysts say, Japan's stock market has myriad reasons to move higher: strong longterm economic growth, a diminishing risk of higher inflation, declining interest rates and, since mid-June, a strengthening yen.  Many institutional investors say they don't expect the Liberal Democrat's losses, mainly to the Japan Socialist Party, to affect economic conditions.  For one thing, the bureaucrats who run the country's powerful ministries are career civil servants, not political appointees.  For another, the Liberal Democrats still contro the more-powerful lower house of the Diet, although an election there is due before next July.  "The assumption in Japan is that the LDP will continue in power -- either on their own or in a coalition they continue to dominate -- or that they lose power but their policies continue," says Barry M. Gillman, managing director at PCM International, a Newark, N.J., unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.  What is really propelling the stock market, then, are fundamental economic factors, professionals say.  Led by strong domestic demand, rising imports and ever-higher exports, Japan's economy grew at an annual rate of 9.1% in 1989's first quarter.  And although economists estimate that it contracted in the second quarter, most still expect the country's total output of goods and services to expand by nearly 5% for the year.  Meanwhile, worries about increasing inflation earlier this year have diminished; most economists expect inflation to remain below 3% this year.  Reflecting reduced inflation fears and the stronger yen, the yields on Japan's 10-year government bonds have already fallen half a percentage point from their peaks, to a shade above 5%.  All this is good news for the Tokyo stock market.  In fact, based on historical patterns, "compared with current interest rates in Japan, the Nikkei should be at around 36000," says Nomura's Mr. Ikeuchi.  Even though Japanese stocks may be poised to go higher, it doesn't mean they are cheap.  At the end of trading yesterday, prices in Tokyo averaged 61 times companies' per-share earnings.  That may sound like a lot to U.S. investors, accustomed as they are to an average price-earnings ratio of about 13, but Japanese investors buy for capital gains, not yield.  So as long as prices appear to be climbing, Japanese investors will keep buying.  Technical factors also lie behind the Tokyo market's rally.  Volume has been lowin June, average daily turnover was only 615.6 million shares, down from 1.75 billion shares a year earlier.  That has prompted big brokerage houses to push trading volume, and thus brokers' commissions, higher by promoting stocks aggressively. (Volume yesterday was about 800 million shares, up from 752 million shares Tuesday and 551.2 million shares Monday.)  Falling interest rates, a stronger yen and the prospect of increased trading volume are luring institutional investors back to the Tokyo market, say analysts.  At the same time, some big Japanese investment trusts that end their fiscal years Sept. 30 are trying to make their results look better by pushing up stock prices.  Wealthy individual investors, especially those who trade on margin, or credit, are also beginning to return to the stock market, say brokers.  Many had huge, unrealized losses in steel and construction stocks.  But now those losses are shrinking, and many big bettors have made a killing in housing stocks, brokers say.  "This has revived individual investors' interest in the market and released more money to trading," says Mr. Ikeuchi.  Some finance experts still worry that political uncertainty could unwind the bright outlook for Japan's markets.  "It's a rather tangled situation still," says Stephen Church, head of research at UBS-Philips & Drew International Ltd. in Tokyo.  Nevertheless, he adds, "We have been surprised before."  With the blood of protest long washed from the streets around Tiananmen Square, China's old guard now turns to the nation's underlying crisis: An economy in such chaos that it threatens to inflame popular passions anew.  From technocrats inside the country and joint-venture partners outside, the prophecy is the same, and bleak: Unless China's new, hardline leadership can untangle the nation's contradictory economic programs, and revive incentive and productivity, the country's stagnation, inflation and shortages will only worsen.  Already, many foreign investors -- chilled by the bloody spring revolt -- are cutting back operations in China or, worse, simply staying home.  "The government isn't dealing with China's economic problems," warns Wu Jinglian, one of China's leading economists.  "As long as those problems aren't solved, the root causes of instability will still exist."  But don't count on any bold innovations from the old guard.  With the economy firmly in the hands of communism's conservatives, retrenchment seems more the order of the day.  When a group of Western bankers recently met in Beijing with Yao Yilin, the country's chief economic planner, they asked him what reform policies China still plans to pursue.  Mr. Yao seemed to draw a blank.  Finally an aide prompted him.  "Price reform," the aide whispered.  "Price reform," Mr. Yao quickly repeated.  It was, the bankers say, unconvincing.  Measuring the effect the revolt had on China's economy is difficult for economists abroad and at home, since most of the problems evident today have been festering for some time.  At the very least, experts here say the revolt cost China dearly in worker morale and productivity.  The best estimates say the two months of unrest resulted in more than $1 billion in lost man-hours and damaged property alone.  At Capital Iron & Steel Works outside Beijing, for example, workers joined the demonstrations en masse, and returned to the line only after tanks swept into Beijing.  To minimize further disruption, factory leaders are giving workers the benefit of the doubt, ascribing their absence to "traffic problems."  Workers now spend long hours studying ideological speeches, amid warnings of severe punishment if they take to the streets again.  The result: Resentment is up, productivity is down.  "Since the unrest, a lot of people aren't working as hard as they should," says Mr. Wu, the economist.  He calls the phenomenon one of the biggest indirect costs of the unrest and subsequent crackdown.  Foreign managers as well are expecting worker responsiveness to wane.  "One of the things we import is Western ways of management," says James Ko, general manager of a General Foods Corp. food-processing joint venture in Canton.  "Now our students will be more reserved in embracing our techniques.  They learned it doesn't pay to be in the forefront."  The unrest has already taken a clear toll on tourism, from which China derived about $2.2 billion in crucial foreign exchange last year.  Between July 1 and Dec. 31, China had been expecting over a million overseas tourists, says Jill Hunt, editor of China Travel Press, a Hong Kong-based trade publication.  But because of the violence, she figures between 600,000 and 900,000 of those visitors won't show up.  As a result, trade officials here say China stands to lose at least $1 billion in foreign exchange.  Early evidence of that loss is everywhere.  At the posh Hong Kong Guilin hotel in Guangxi province, which would normally be packed with foreign tourists, the revolving restaurant lurches on its unsteady course for just two Western diners.  A taxi driver at the airport grumbles that he has had to wait four hours for a fare.  On the banks of the Li River in Guilin, one die-hard vendor, tries an appeal to the heart: "I haven't sold anything to a foreign friend for a month now," he complains, proffering calligraphy brushes, "and I'm not getting enough to eat."  In downtown Beijing, there are huge swaths of land cleared for construction of 10,000 new hotel rooms that were planned for the next two years.  But projects are being delayed.  Over the last few weeks, construction crews at some have simply stopped showing up.  But the damage done to tourism is almost insignificant compared with how the crackdown affected the international business community.  Angered by the violence this spring, Western governments and aid groups have delayed or restricted loans.  Commercial banks, already worried about China's long-term economic travails, have tightened credit.  And various joint ventures have either cut back production or delayed planned new investment.  For China, a country starved for technical know-how and basic infrastructure, these have been severe blows.  Expecting a slowdown in trade, the government of Canada, for example, has trimmed its commercial staff in Beijing by about a third.  International Business Machines Corp. has given up about 35% of the office space it rents and has turned back to Beijing's Lido Hotel about half of the 29 apartments it uses for employees.  The Canton office of Nissho Iwai Corp., a Japanese trading company that did about $200 million in business with China last year, says it expects business to be off 50% this year.  East Asiatic Co. (Hong Kong) Ltd., a Danish trading company, is also bracing for a slump: It has trimmed its staff of 160 employees in China by 37.  Direct investment is also cooling.  Peugeot SA and PepsiCo Inc. have postponed expanding their separate joint-venture factories in southern China.  According to one Western trade official, five Fortune 500 companies had plans to invest a total of $650 million in China operations, but, because of the worsening economic and political outlook, only one of the five still plans to proceed.  A Japanese trade official, meanwhile, estimates that Japanese companies -- always leery of China -- will invest "less than half" the $200 million they committed last year.  Meanwhile, an increasing number of banks have been stepping back from long-term lending and have jacked up short-term rates to account for the new risk they see in doing business with China.  International financial institutions, including the World Bank, have postponed considering $1.2 billion in loans.  Japan has also postponed a six-year, $5.7 billion loan program that was intended to finance 42 major projects in China, including railways, ports, dams and telecommunications systems.  Choking off the flow of cash has an immediate effect in China.  The decision by several Western governments and aid agencies to freeze low-cost loans, for example, has thrown a hydroelectric-power project in southwest China into doubt.  Johnson K.M. Li, a manager with Asea Brown Boveri China Ltd., a Swiss-Swedish company responsible for the project, says that without outside money "we have no chance.  They {the Chinese} can't afford to build the project without foreign financing."  Credit in general could prove the undoing of many domestic and foreign enterprises.  Many of China's banks are strapped for cash, particularly since there was an outflow of funds last year when nervous depositors saw economic trouble in the offing.  The general manager of one American food-processing joint venture that sells within China says he will be struggling this year to keep the decline in his sales to just 20%.  The problem: His buyers have money on deposit in Chinese banks, but the banks, lacking cash, can't honor withdrawals.  "It will get worse before it gets better," he predicts.  All this is occurring against a backdrop of a sick economy growing sicker.  An increasing number of economists conclude that a plunge in national output and a significant recession is inevitable in China.  The dominoes tumble from there: A recession could mean huge losses at state-run factories, requiring a bailout from the state of billions of dollars, further draining depleted state coffers.  Last year, bail-out subsidies rose 18% to $12 billion, and ate up one-third of total state revenue.  According to the economists' scenario, thousands of smaller, semiprivate enterprises, particularly in rural areas, would probably go bankrupt, since they have no state-financed safety net and are at the mercy of available credit.  A collapse in this sector could help create China's first large-scale unemployment since the Communists took control in 1949.  Those displaced workers, the experts warn, could present a potent new source of unrest.  The nation's industrial production was up 11% in the first half of this year, trailing the 17% rise in the year-earlier period.  This is good news for those hoping to bring down inflation, which has been driven by an overheated economy.  But the cooling is uneven.  State enterprises, for example, are stagnant.  But nonstate businesses continue to grow too rapidly, fueling fears that this part of the economy is soon due for a hard landing.  The country's trade deficit grew to $5.79 billion in the first six months of this year, a nearly fivefold increase from a year earlier.  Foreign debt, continuing to grow, stands at $40 billion.  As they try to rein in the country's spending, China's economic hard-liners are already starting to centralize authority again.  Until now, for example, PepsiCo's bottling plant in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in southern China has seen explosive sales growth -- from 2.5 million cases in 1984 to 7.2 million cases last year -- partly because cities were allowed to issue permits for distributors to buy Pepsi.  Now the central government must grant that permission, and it doesn't want to expand the number of distributors.  PepsiCo expects sales to stagnate this year.  Another retrenchment: The state is talking about limiting the "reasonable" profit that private Chinese enterprises can reap, in an effort to reduce growing income disparities.  The slogan of the last decade of reform was, "To Get Rich Is Glorious."  No longer, it seems.  A shortage of energy and raw materials is already wreaking havoc in many of China's major industries.  A factory that makes Nike shoes in Guangdong Province has to run a generator three days a week to stay in operation.  The plant's Taiwanese joint-venture partners are stockpiling coal and oil for power, in case their supplies get cut off.  Many nearby Chinese factories simply shut down two or three days a week for want of energy.  Moreover, 2,000 workers at the Tianjin aluminum-products factory recently were ordered home because the company couldn't get enough raw materials.  At one point this year, supply shortages forced a third of the nation's aluminum factories to close.  Last year, high prices and shortages of fertilizer in the agricultural sector triggered widespread outbreaks of peasant violence.  So did the state's use of IOUs, instead of cash, to pay for grain.  Beijing is desperately trying to avoid a repeat this year, but funds are short, and IOUs are again likely.  Farmer's Daily reports that the government may be able to pay cash for only half this year's crop.  Coming up with cash for grain purchases will mean either printing more money -- thus exacerbating the country's high inflation -- or trimming expenses elsewhere.  The Party has lately been trumpeting the value of "frugal living," a possible signal that a limit may be put on wage increases.  "Any cut in wages will kill worker incentive," says a western economist.  "If that happens, production will nosedive."  And unrest would likely mount.  As the regime veers from market-oriented economic policies back to a more Soviet-style command system, inflation will be on everyone's mind.  It is at the root of the country's economic problems and fanned much of the revolution of rising expectations evident in the Spring rebellion.  Consider the paradox that reform wrought at Capital Iron & Steel, often presented as a model of Deng Xiaoping's policies.  The past decade of liberalization saw profits at the city-sized factory rise 20% a year, bolstered by an incentive system under which the factory pays a fixed amount to the state and retains the rest for reinvestment and salaries.  The wages of the 180,000 workers at the factory tripled since reforms began in 1978.  But, at the same time, inflation ran rampant.  Prices for many vital foods and consumer goods have doubled in the past year alone.  The overall inflation rate -- about 25% by official reckoning -- more than wiped out the 16% average wage increase workers at the factory earned this year.  Thus, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of workers from China's model factory flooded the streets in Beijing this spring in protest.  Political indoctrination alone can't keep that from happening again.  But it is unclear whether the regime's economic retrenchment can either.  Volkswagen of America Inc. unveiled its new Corrado sports coupe, which the company hopes will become the first step toward reversing its sagging fortunes in the U.S.  The Corrado contains standard features rarely, if ever, seen on previous Volkswagen products.  The car, which carries a base price of $17,900, has the first tilt steering wheel ever on a VW model.  Standard equipment includes power windows, mirrors and door locks, as well as air conditioning, all previously sold mainly as options.  The equipment represents a victory for VW officials in the U.S., who have labored to persuade their West German bosses to stop shipping cars with stark appointments to compete against well-equipped Japanese vehicles.  After spurning such requests for years, VW executives now see Japanese auto makers poised to invade the European market and are starting to get the message.  To increase the focus on customer demands, they recently imported U.S. management guru Tom Peters, co-author of "In Search of Excellence," to address their corporate management conference in Barcelona, Spain.  The Corrado also employs the first engine supercharger that VW has ever sold in the U.S. -- which gives the 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine 158 horsepower and a top speed of 140 miles an hour.  "The Corrado is a way to get people thinking about Volkswagen again," says William J. Young, vice president for the U.S. sales unit.  "But we're trying to completely rebuild our franchise, and the only way to do that is to get more from our high-volume models."  The Corrado won't be among them.  At full production, VW can make only 36,000 of the cars each year, and just 10,000 a year will reach the U.S.  The company's two mainstays, the Golf and Jetta models, won't get a complete overhaul until 1992.  But VW hopes the Corrado will be an image-maker and allow it to compete against the likes of Toyota Motor Corp.'s Celica, Nissan Motor Co.'s 240SX and Ford Motor Co.'s Probe GT.  After reaching a peak 7% share of the U.S. car market and outselling all other imports combined in 1970, VW clung to just 1.5% of the market last year.  This year, the company's first-half sales plummeted 25% below a year earlier.  Worse yet, VW is trying to resurrect itself against the heaviest competition ever in the U.S. Last year, even newcomer Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea outsold VW by more than 96,000 cars.  Volkswagen's woes have been legion.  The cars carry high U.S. price tags in their segment, stemming partly from the dollar's decline from three years ago.  The company's product cycles are long; by time the Golf and Jetta are revamped, they'll be about eight years old, nearly the length of three cycles for Japanese cars.  Then there's been bad luck and bad planning.  The Volkswagen Fox subcompact was originally brought to the U.S. from Brazil in 1986 as VW's latest attempt to market an entry-level car.  But rampant Brazilian inflation sent Fox prices soaring and Volkswagen failed to offer an optional automatic transmission.  The company's continuing decline has severely pinched VW dealers.  John Campbell, a big Southern California dealer, says his VW sales have dropped 30% to 40% this year because "we have a number of models that are stale and have fallen off the charts."  Adds Robert LaTorre, a Reseda, Calif., dealer: "We're suffering from a lack of new products.  Every year it seems like we're selling something we had a hard time selling the year before at a lower price.  We need some pizazz."  The Corrado can provide that, with its acceleration from zero to 60 miles an hour in 7.5 seconds.  Dealers are pleased, but wanted the car sooner.  It was supposed to arrive in the U.S. last March, but was held back for engine-mount modifications.  Early next year, VW dealers will get another new model: the Passat, a midsized sedan that will compete against the Nissan Maxima.  Like the Corrado, it's expected to be priced below $20,000 -- far higher than VW's traditional selling ground, but below what VW's U.S. sales officials feared headquarters might demand.  "We have to get back to our roots of selling affordable cars," says Mr. Young, "instead of cars people buy when they can't afford a BMW."  The capital-gains debate has veered badly off track.  The issue has become embroiled in partisan politics as opponents have charged that rate reduction would be unfair and would benefit only a small segment of taxpayers.  As a Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, I believe a capital-gains differential benefits all Americans.  The real issues in the debate have nothing to do with privilege or partisanship.  The real issues are economic, and they are important: growth in America's productivity, strengthening our ability to compete for expanding world markets, and the creation of new jobs and opportunities for our workers.  For more than a generation Democrats and Republicans have understood that it makes good economic sense to provide incentives for those who place capital at risk as part of the effort to create a growing, dynamic, competitive American economy.  In his 1963 message to Congress calling for a monumental tax-reduction bill, President Kennedy asked for a maximum tax on capital gains of 19.5% on individuals and 22% on corporations.  In words that ring true today, President Kennedy pointed out that the existing higher tax on capital gains was "both inequitable and a barrier to economic growth."  Over the years capital-gains initiatives in Congress have benefited from strong bipartisan support.  For example, in 1978 when the exclusion of capital gains from taxable income was raised from 50% to 60%, the initiative was not viewed as partisan.  In fact it was led in the Senate by Democrats Russell Long and Alan Cranston as well as many Republicans.  Reduced taxation of capital gains has a proven record of success in helping to build a stronger American economy.  Lower capital rates help encourage entrepreneurs to commit their resources to the newer, risky ventures that may fail, but when successful can produce the jobs and exports of the future.  They also will provide a powerful incentive for savings and investment at precisely the time our economy most needs it.  Countries that save less invest less, and gradually lose their ability to compete.  Net U.S. savings averaged only 5.3% of gross domestic product over 1973 to 1986 compared with 10.3% in West Germany and 18.6% in Japan.  The capital cost of investment in new equipment is an important factor in any country's ability to compete, and restoration of a capital-gains tax rate can help bring that cost down in the U.S. Capital costs in this country are twice as high as in Japan and substantially higher than those in most other industrial nations.  Our foreign competitors long have recognized the important link among low capital-gains taxation, economic growth and international competitiveness.  Most either do not tax capital gains at all or tax them only lightly.  In our own country, the potential positive impact of reduced capital-gains taxation can be enormous; one recent study suggests that a permanent reduction of the capital-gains tax rate to 15% would lower the capital cost of investing in new equipment by 14%.  For 25 years Republicans and Democrats, in Congress and in the White House, generally have supported a capital-gains tax rate and the U.S. economy has benefited as a result.  Recently, however, it has been suggested that a capital-gains rate is "unfair" because a disproportionate share of the benefit would go to taxpayers earning more than $200,000 a year.  In fact, there are many more taxpayers with moderate incomes who realize capital gains than there are in the higher-income brackets.  Three-fourths of all tax returns with capital gains were reported by taxpayers with wage and salary incomes of less than $50,000, and nearly half of all capital-gains dollars go to people with incomes under $50,000.  In addition, it should be noted that our capital-gains tax-cut proposal is highly progressive.  Most of the revenues gained from our proposed cut will come from upper-income taxpayers, but most of the proceeds will be used for programs that benefit those with lower incomes: expansion of the earned income credit to assist child care, the low-income housing credit, employer-provided education assistance, targeted jobs tax credit, and health insurance for the self-employed.  Partisan politics really has no place in the debate over an economic issue as important as reducing the capital-gains tax rate.  The capital-gains proposal supported by a majority in the Ways and Means Committee is not a Republican idea or a Democratic idea.  It is an idea that makes sense for America.  Rep. Michael A. Andrews (D., Texas)  Washington  (See related letter: "Capital Gains Tax Cut: for the Rich..." -- WSJ Aug. 3, 1989)  Psst.  Here's a little secret for people planning to invest in an insurance product: Haggling with your agent can often mean higher investment returns.  Unknown to most investors, some insurers offer two or more products that are essentially the same, except for the size of the commissions they pay to agents and others who sell the products.  The product that pays the most to the agent is typically the one that's least generous to the investor.  The differences can be significant.  Consider a couple of annuity contracts offered by United Services General Life Co., a unit of Equitable of Iowa Cos. in Des Moines.  An annuity is a tax-deferred retirement savings plan that resembles an individual retirement account.  With one of United Services annuities, 4.25% of the money an investor pays in goes as a commission to the person selling the contract; with the other, the commission is 8.5%.  The lower-commission contract promises to pay 8.62% interest for the first year, while the one with the higher commission offers 8%.  The lower-commission annuity also has a lower "surrender charge," or penalty for pulling out of the contract in the first several years.  Higher commissions can also reduce the investment value of life insurance policies that include a savings component, such as universal life policies.  In general, policies with higher commissions have lower "surrender values."  That's what policyholders get if they cash in the policy or what they can borrow through policy loans.  The trade-off between commissions and policy benefits is simply a matter of mathematics.  While commissions on insurance products are paid by the companies, not directly by policy buyers, buyers ultimately bear the cost.  As the commission goes up, "we need to recapture that somewhere else in the product pricing," says Paul Larson, chief financial officer of Equitable of Iowa.  Because they don't pay it directly, most investors probably have no idea how much the commission is.  And insurance agents and other sellers have no incentive to tell clients about a low-commission, high-benefit product when they would prefer to sell a high-commission version.  "The choice would be obvious.  It's like saying, 'Do you want this for $125, $110 or $100?'" says John Branton, whose Philadelphia marketing firm helps Equitable of Iowa sell a range of annuities.  Insurance companies do highlight the product ranges in trade-publication advertising aimed at potential sales agents.  For instance, a recent ad from Bradford National Life Insurance Co., Lexington, Ky., promoted the firm's Stable Reserve IV universal life policy "for the tough competition]" and its Stable Reserve III "for top commissions]"  Company officials say they have good reasons for offering similar products with different commissions.  Varying commission levels allow sellers to match their pay to the type and costs of their own operations, or to the amount of work they put into a particular client engagement, these insurers say.  For example, a savings and loan association that sells annuities without extensive financial counseling might go with the low-commission version, says Walter J. Hughes, executive vice president of American Life & Casualty Insurance Co. in Des Moines.  His company's high-commission product is often chosen by life insurance agents who "will do a great deal of financial planning for folks and will not charge a fee for it," he says.  Insurance agents who represent more than one company have long had the option of selecting a low-commission product from one insurer or a high-commission product from another.  Even so, many people in the insurance industry are critical of the minority of insurers that make it easy for agents to make such self-interested choices within a single product line.  "It puts the agent in a moral dilemma" of having to benefit himself or his client at the other's expense, says Jack E. Bobo, executive vice president of the National Association of Life Underwriters, a Washington-based trade group of life insurance agents.  Similarly, Daniel T. Cox, president of Life Insurance Co. of Virginia, Richmond, says his company "is not in the pick-your-commission game" because it doesn't want to put that "awful burden" on its sales force.  Product lines that vary chiefly in commission levels are also unfair to purchasers, says Glenn Daily, insurance product analyst with Seidman Financial Services in New York.  "It's a one-sided negotiation," he says.  "The buyer doesn't know there is a range in which he could negotiate."  But investors considering insurance products can arm themselves by talking with several sellers -- and making it clear that they're shopping around.  Industry experts say agents who know they are dealing with an informed buyer are apt to present an insurance policy or annuity with a lower commission than the agent usually seeks.  Or at least they'll be less likely to try taking advantage of a buyer by pushing a product with a particularly high commission.  In some ways it's no different from buying a car, says Jerry Shutt, vice president for marketing support at Bradford National.  "In going to your local Chevrolet dealer, he is under no obligation to show you the best-priced vehicle he has available," Mr. Shutt says.  "There is really an onus on the individual to do his shopping."  From George Gilder's new book, "Microcosm" (Simon & Schuster):  Free access to the limited resources of the radio frequency spectrum already represents a powerful subsidy for broadcast interests competing with computers and fiber optics.  Far from expanding these subsidies by granting extra bandwidth for through-the-air analog broadcast technologies such as HDTV, however, the FCC should actually begin a phased withdrawal of current TV spectrum space.  Since television has the far better alternative of fiber and cable, the FCC should continue doggedly to deny TV broadcasters scarce spectrum resources.  Spectrum space is sorely needed by such mobile systems as cellular phones, laptop computers, paging systems, CB radios, air and ground traffic controllers, and a wide array of other portable uses for police, medical, military, trucking, Federal Express, and other vital public needs.  The ultimate vision of the Dick Tracy wristwatch phone, using spectrum on every hand, moves closer year by year.  Thursday, Aug. 3, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Out of Mind."  This segment of "48 Hours" spotlights the problems of the severely mentally ill, now that we are accustomed to seeing them adrift on our city streets.  Saturdays, Aug. 5-19, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on A&E (repeated at 1 a.m.): "The Rainbow."  When it was first published in 1915, D.H. Lawrence's strange, intense novel about a young woman's conflicting needs for love and liberation was suppressed.  Now it's a BBC-TV miniseries.  Not to be confused with the recent feature film by Ken Russell, this three-hour TV film is the most successful screen adaptation of Lawrence to date.  Sunday, Aug. 6, 1-4 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "American Bowl '89."  The Cleveland Browns and the Philadelphia Eagles meet in London's Wembley Stadium as the NFL kicks off its exhibition season.  Monday, Aug. 7, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): "Dawn's Early Light: Ralph McGill and the Segregated South."  The first film to document the life of the famous editor of the Atlanta Constitution who took a stand against segregation in the 1960s while also trying to understand and communicate with his fellow white Southerners.  Wednesday, Aug. 9, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Fatal Addictions."  This NBC News special will remind us that the inner-city crack epidemic is not the only calamity of its kind.  A week later, "Gangs, Cops & Drugs" (Tuesday and Wednesday, Aug. 1516, 10-11 p.m. EDT, also on NBC) will remind us that the problem of the inner city is nonetheless the worst.  Thursday, Aug. 10, 9-11:30 p.m. EDT, on A&E (repeated at 1 a.m. and Aug. 13): "The Rivals."  Watching reruns of "All in the Family" just to hear Archie Bunker's malapropisms?  This BBC production of Sheridan's classic farce revives the original Mrs. Malaprop -- a shrewd awakening, if ever there was one.  Thursday, Aug. 10, 8:05-9:05 p.m. EDT, on TBS (repeated on Aug. 12 and 17): "Comin' Home: A Rockin' Reunion."  Instead of paying to see Dennis Quaid lampoon Jerry Lee Lewis in "Great Balls of Fire," watch this documentary about the real good ol' days of rockabilly.  Dick Clark interviews Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and the late Roy Orbison.  Friday and Saturday, Aug. 11-12, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on VH-1: "Woodstock."  The 1960s generation may now relive its greatest gathering via this broadcast of an edited version of the Warner Bros. film.  VH-1 will also air a special on Woodstock on Friday, Aug. 11, 8-9 p.m. (repeated Aug. 12, 13 and 15).  Saturday, Aug. 12, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on Showtime (repeated Aug. 16, 21, 27, 31 and Sept. dates to be announced): "The Turn of the Screw."  Despite the presence of Amy Irving, this film of Henry James's psychological/supernatural thriller has two flaws.  First, it was shot in Beverly Hills in 100-degree heat -- not Victorian enough to be convincing.  Second, it portrays a young governness driven to evil visions by the presence of nude paintings -- too Victorian to be convincing.  Sunday, Aug. 13, 8 p.m.-midnight EDT and 5-9 p.m. PDT (repeated at midnight EDT and 9 p.m. PDT) on Pay Per View Cable TV: "Moscow Music Peace Festival."  Presented on MTV, this hard-rock concert from Lenin Stadium claims the mantle of Woodstock.  The negative difference is in the music -- instead of Sly Stone, the Band and Crosby, Stills & Nash, this concert has Bon Jovi, Scorpions and Motley Crue.  The positive difference is in the message -- instead of being blissed out, this concert is rhetorically sober.  In fact, it's a benefit for the anti-drug Make A Difference Foundation, which was founded by Doc McGhee as part of his community service probation for a minor drug conviction.  Oh -- did I mention that Doc McGhee manages Bon Jovi, Scorpions and Motley Crue?  Monday, Aug. 14, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "James Baldwin: The Price of the Ticket."  This "American Masters" film offers a fascinating look at the brilliance, self-indulgence and self-righteousness of the late writer.  It is 103 degrees along state highway 340 outside this central Texas town.  Semitrailer trucks and cars whiz by at 55 miles per hour, blasting hot air and dust in Daniel Syrek's face as he kicks over a piece of metal lying along the road.  It is a smashed wheelcover -- what Mr. Syrek calls "accidental litter."  He clicks a hand counter to record the finding.  Is this any way for a 62-year-old Californian to make a living?  "Sure, it gets hot sometimes, it gets wet sometimes, it gets gritty out here," he says, bending over to examine a piece of cardboard, then clicking his hand counter again.  "But these last 16 years have been the best in my life."  As an expert on roadside refuse -- perhaps the nation's foremost expert -- Mr. Syrek has peered into culverts, crawled through weeds and sloshed through mud along the highways and byways of America, counting litter.  Dressed in hiking shoes, shorts, a yellow hard hat and an orange mesh vest with yellow reflector stripes, the energetic, bespectacled Mr. Syrek has examined millions of pieces of litter and spied on thousands of litterers in 17 states.  Litter statistics roll readily off his tongue.  Did you know that littering declines 50% in the rain, but doubles when the temperature rises from 50 degrees to 75 degrees?  That 70% of all litterers are under 35 and 75% are male?  That 17% of all litter comes from trash blowing out of pickup trucks?  That deliberate litter accounts for 55% of all roadside trash?  Or that about 2% of fast-food packages end up as roadside litter?  With such data, Mr. Syrek has helped states hone anti-litter programs to fit the profiles of the miscreants.  Forget cute little animals and polite slogans, he advises: Litterers "don't understand the word 'please.' They're thoughtless slobs, they're Bubbas.  You have to hit them between the eyes with a 2-by-4."  Embracing his data -- and his outrage -- four years ago Texas created its now-famous battle cry: "Don't Mess With Texas."  "He helped us figure out what would be the best way to make this program work," says Donald Clark, director of Texas' litter program.  Neighboring Oklahoma, another client, recently launched its equally bellicose slogan: "Don't lay that trash on Oklahoma."  Nebraska, California and Hawaii have reduced litter by heeding his advice, his statistics show.  For two weeks recently, Mr. Syrek conducted his fourth annual survey of Texas litter.  Since the program started three years ago, he reports, Texans are messing up their roadsides 60% less.  How does he know?  This year, with his wife, Betty, Mr. Syrek drove 2,500 Texas miles, stopping at the same 150 randomly picked roadways he visited last year.  He quickly walks along the edge of the road, counting paces with a clicker in his left hand and litter with the clicker in his right hand.  Then he examines the litter, categorizing it as accidental or deliberate.  Mrs. Syrek stays in the car and counts traffic, pedestrians and don't-litter signs.  It's not every woman's dream vacation, but she won't stay home.  "It gets lonely when he's gone," she explains.  And it's not all drudgery: They picnic along rural roadsides, swim at small-town motels and do plenty of sightseeing.  The results of these surveys are analyzed later in the Syreks' Sacramento, Calif., home, at the loftily named Institute for Applied Research.  The name is left over from the days Mr. Syrek and his institute partners worked on sexier projects, such as analyzing malfunction warning systems in Apollo spacecraft.  But after doing his first litter survey in the 1970s, for the state of California, Mr. Syrek was hooked; his partners moved on to other pursuits, and he became a litter legend, albeit in a notably uncrowded field.  "People think litter is so simple anyone can deal with it.  Bull," says Mr. Syrek.  Using 25 software programs he wrote himself, he adjusts his traffic counts for the time of day (litter is a function of traffic, and traffic rises and falls at different times).  He statistically discounts for weed height (tall weeds hide litter) and drought (it thins the grass and makes litter easier to see).  With such variables as traffic, weather and road type, he says he can predict how much litter a section of highway will have.  Each year, using Mr. Syrek's data, Texas adjusts its campaign.  Noting that deliberate littering had decreased but accidental littering hadn't, Mr. Syrek suggested last year that ads focus on untidy trucks.  So the new commercials featured musician Jerry Jeff Walker sitting in the back of a messy pickup.  In one year, accidental litter declined about 10%, Mr. Syrek proudly reports.  "We tapped into the consciousness of Texans," says Tim McClure, executive creative director for GSD&M, the Austin-based advertising agency that came up with the "Don't Mess With Texas" slogan and handles the campaign.  Of course, he adds, such belligerence won't necessarily work everywhere.  "People in other states just don't think the same way," he explains.  "Don't Mess With Rhode Island?  Get outta here; it won't work."  As passionate as he is about litter, Mr. Syrek simply can't pick it up alone.  For a "visible count," as he recently did for Texas, he charges $15,000 to $20,000.  It costs $45,000 for a full-blown cleanup survey, which requires helpers whom he pays about $100 a day.  Mr. Syrek's surveys can be revealing, even surprising.  Littering is worse in the South because of its many warm days; more people stop at places like Dairy Queen for a treat, then throw used containers out open car windows.  And Oregon isn't as clean as its image.  "People in Oregon get real smug about how clean their state is," he says.  "But if you adjust for rainfall and temperature, they're no cleaner than anyone else."  As trucks and cars zip by, Mr. Syrek may, in one sense, be living life in the fast lane.  But his findings are fairly humdrum.  Along a 77-pace stretch of I-35 on his recent Waco survey, for instance, he discovers an old hat, rubber gloves, peanut bags, cans, bottles, cigarette packs and asphalt shingles.  He chronicles a veritable museum of fast-food artifacts -- cartons and cups from McDonald's, Taco Bueno, Whataburger and Jack in the Box.  Mr. Syrek maintains a rigid lexicon for his litter.  Litter, he explains, "is solid waste that man throws in the wrong place."  He bristles when someone calls litter "trash."  Trash is solid waste in the right place -- garbage cans and landfills.  A dead bird found on the side of a street isn't litter or trash; it's simply a dead bird.  At six sites surveyed in Waco, he finds only one item worth keeping: a note blown off a windshield.  "I'm so glad I met you baby," it reads.  He will add it to his collection of lost love notes.  One of his favorites: a letter from a young man to his girlfriend's mother that described his intentions as strictly honorable.  The letter was torn in half and tossed unopened.  He has also found salary checks (he tracks down the owners), full bottles of beer (probably chucked by kids pursued by police), shopping bags with new clothes and guns.  People are what they litter, he suggests.  "One of the reasons I like Nebraska is I never found hypodermic needles, no pornography.  Litter reflects the life style."  His own polls show that Americans rate litter as their No. 2 pollution concern, after air pollution, Mr. Syrek says.  Yet the Environmental Protection Agency has no litter program and states spend millions to clean up roadways but little on prevention, he says.  Texas spent $25 million on cleanup in 1985, and the cost was rising 15% a year before its preventive, $3 million-a-year, "Don't Mess with Texas" campaign began.  The educational and public-relations aspects of the campaign were so successful that the state dropped plans for a $1 million law-enforcement drive to go along with it.  As a man whose mind is littered with such concerns, Mr. Syrek even sees Glasnost, Perestroika and arms reductions as cleanup opportunities.  If peace with the Soviets means the U.S. spends less on its military, "we can now get on to other things, like cleaning up litter," he reasons.  "Isn't it great?"  Every time my husband and I visit our son, Bruce, I wonder if he will acknowledge we are there.  Living as he does, in the shell of autism, what is he feeling -- seeing?  Bruce, who is 32 years old, lives in a group home with other autistics.  They have the same diagnosis, but verbally, emotionally, and in many ways they are quite different.  Bruce is not a savant, as was Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man."  He can play an excellent game of chess and usually wins when he plays checkers with me.  His language deals mostly with his food choices, his baking or his calendars, which line his walls.  He is interested in pointing out every holiday and everyone's birthday.  If any visit to his group home is merely hectic, we're thankful.  Take a recent party we attended there.  This time, as we entered, Bruce brushed past us -- no greeting.  We were nonexistent.  His medication is being reduced, so every contact has an element of possible mayhem.  Bruce was talking, arguing nonstop with himself most of the evening.  "Something about wheat," one of the staffers told us.  Long ago I'd told him wheat or rye bread was better for him than white.  For some time he'd say, "Good for me," when on his fifth or sixth slice of bread.  Why the big deal now?  Had he seen wheat fields on TV?  In a magazine?  Every so often he'd stop mid-sentence and say, "You know what?"  "What?"  I asked.  Off he went with his monologue.  Once I heard, "The boy wants to go home."  Was he urging a home visit?  But he'd said that while at home, and I'd then wondered if he wanted to go back to his group home.  Ann was drinking the dip.  Several parents' hands offered chips.  Ann didn't want chips, just the dip.  Susan left the party to go to sleep.  She alternately slept and wept.  When too much persuasion was urged, she threw things -- so none was employed.  I had recently had cataract surgery and was rather careful about where I sat or stood.  At one point I bravely sat on the couch next to my son.  On the other side of him was a behavior specialist.  At one point, Bruce turned and peered into my eyes.  Sometimes he'll lean forward and look into my eyes with a deep intensity. (Usually autistics avoid eye contact, but no definition is true for each person with this disease.) Is he thinking, "Who is this person?  What shall I do about it?"  Sometimes I'm fearful.  Guilt?  Worry?  Is this really my life?  This time he cut into his observation with, "You know what?"  Back to his norm.  He then leaned over the behavior specialist in a threatening manner.  The house manager leaned over the back of the sofa and directly over Bruce.  I covered my eye.  Nothing happened.  Ben was biting a hole in his shirt.  His mother gave him a piece of fruit and signed, "Good for you."  Ben does not speak at all.  He shook his head and reached for the chocolate.  The Smith boy was compacting the trash.  He was correcting his father about the collection of paper cups.  I hoped he'd not get too upset.  I'd been told that he sometimes ripped a person's shirt off.  I had spoken with a very pretty young female staffer.  "I can't see him doing that.  He's so calm and relaxed looking."  "Oh, he does," she answered quickly.  "He ripped my blouse and bra off one day.  It was very embarrassing."  They were offering a birthday grab bag.  Reach in and find your surprise.  Somehow my son chose the perfect gift for him.  A calendar] Everyone cheered.  In the kitchen mothers were stirring and whipping.  A father was carving a turkey.  My curry puffs were burning.  The Smith boy was at the trash again.  Ben's mother was serving the turkey.  Bruce had eaten some as it was being carved.  Normally, I'd have steered him out of the room and into some creative pursuit, but what the hell.  He was quiet, nonaggressive and eating something other than sugar.  I had observed the entire performance with my good eye.  So be it]  One of our gifts for Bruce was a game where small fish open their mouths as they revolve on a metal pond.  One fishes with poles that have a magnetic base.  I loved it.  Bruce did one quick swing with his pole and left the room.  We also gave him a dot-to-dot book, which he did until he noticed dessert.  The games I spent hours seeking -- correct age level and somewhat durable, without being sturdy enough to be used as a weapon -- sat in a pile, ignored.  Next day my sister asked, "Why did you go to the party, with your recent surgery and all?"  How does one answer such a question?  I know that Bruce expected us, and that as his mind wove in and out and peeked into our world, as he observed the wrapped gifts, the pink punch, the rooms full of people, he joined us in his way.  As Ann drank the dip, as Ben signed his wishes, as the young Smith boy asserted his right to neat trash, Bruce knew.  He knew that this was a party for him and his housemates and "his staff," as he called them.  These young people don't reach out and pat you on the shoulder.  They reach out and grab a chicken leg or someone else's gift.  They may reach out and leave a memory of the day colored black and blue, but they're our kids.  That's why I went.  ---  Mrs. Mokren, a free-lance writer, lives in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.  Stock prices rose and the dollar strengthened modestly as nervous investors bided their time ahead of tomorrow's July employment report.  Bond prices slipped in late trading.  A late rally pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 16.32 points to 2657.44 in active trading but still left it short of Monday's post-crash high of 2660.66.  The gains in Treasury bonds were much more muted, and trading in currency markets was slack.  Traders said the employment report will give investors a better sense of just how rapidly the economy is weakening.  Economists expect the report to show that the economy created about 150,000 jobs last month.  But attention will be focused on the manufacturing sector, which is expected to show a net loss of jobs.  That would add to the perceptions of a rapidly sinking manufacturing sector and keep alive nagging worries about a possible recession.  But if investors are worried about a recession, they seem to be more worried right now that they might miss new highs in the stock market.  Analysts said expectations of a soft landing -- moderate economic growth with less inflation and lower interest rates -- pervades the market despite prices that are near record levels.  "It's just a matter of time before we see a new high in the Dow industrials," said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham.  Smith Barney says the industrials could hit 3000 before the end of the year.  The record close for the industrials is 2722.42, set Aug. 25, 1987.  The gains made by bond prices early this week, meanwhile, looked like a harbinger of steeper declines in economic activity than the stock market reflects.  Treasury bonds initially made additional gains yesterday but gave them up late in the day after the Treasury disclosed details of its next quarterly refinancing operation.  Currency traders said the dollar's rebound doesn't change the underlying trend toward further weakness as the U.S. economy slips and interest rates fall.  One currency trader said that although dealers may have been a bit hasty in their selling of dollars early in the week, they remain convinced that the economy is going to weaken more than stock prices currently reflect.  In major market activity:  Stock prices climbed in active trading.  Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 181.8 million shares.  Advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners, 866-680.  Bond prices dropped in late trading.  The price on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell slightly.  The yield rose to 7.84%.

RJR Nabisco Inc. posted a second-quarter net loss of $309 million, but it reported a 24% jump in operating profit from its core businesses.  The food and tobacco giant, acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out completed earlier this year, reported a net loss because of $1.05 billion of interest and debt expenses.  A year earlier, the company had net income of $350 million, or $1.50 a share.  Revenue for RJR, which showed strong gains in the quarter in cash flow but continued weakness at its domestic-tobacco unit, increased 4% to $3.91 billion from $3.75 billion.  "The company is ahead of schedule in divesting businesses that are not essential to our future strategy," said RJR's chairman and chief executive officer, Louis V. Gerstner Jr.  "At the same time, our core businesses are exceeding expectations for earnings and cash flow."  RJR reported second-quarter operating profit from its core business units of $848 million, up 24% from $683 million a year earlier.  Those "business unit contribution" figures don't include $139 million of "goodwill" charges in the recent period, compared with $29 million a year earlier.  After those charges, RJR had $709 million of total operating profit in the second quarter, compared with $654 million a year earlier.  But while several analysts agreed that New York-based RJR appears on target in garnering enough cash to pay its huge debt obligations, some cautioned that the company's core U.S. tobacco business remains troubled.  Overall, RJR's operating profit from tobacco grew 16% in the quarter to $577 million from $496 million a year earlier.  But its U.S. tobacco volume declined 9%, according to Marc Cohen, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein.  Some of that U.S. shipment decline was attributable to the company's effort to change its inventory practices, according to an RJR spokesman.  But "as much as half of it is due to consumption declines," said Mr. Cohen.  "Turning that volume decline around is one of RJR's key challenges, along with reducing debt."  The RJR spokesman said the company has stabilized its market-share losses at about 33% of the U.S. cigarette market, the same share RJR held a year ago, he said.  He attributed the company's increase in tobacco operating profit to strong growth internationally and productivity improvements.  Roy Burry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., disagreed with RJR's assessment that its U.S. tobacco market share has leveled off.  He said he expects U.S. tobacco consumption to fall 3% to 4% this year, but he expects RJR's domestic tobacco shipments to plummet by at least 5%.  "That's a very large number for RJR Nabisco's long-term meal ticket," he said.  On the food side, RJR's operating profit jumped 40% to $303 million on a 3% rise in revenue to $2.01 billion.  Analysts and the company attributed the sharp rise to reductions in the company's advertising and marketing expenses and to the smash success of Nabisco's Teddy Grahams snack food.  Teddy Grahams, introduced just last year, have surged to become the third-largest seller among cookies in the U.S., the RJR spokesman said.  Andros Analyzers Inc. said it signed sales and service contracts valued at more than $17 million.  The company makes and markets diagnostic equipment for medical and automotive markets.  Liposome Technology Inc. said it received a patent on a delivery system for the drug minoxidil, used to treat male pattern baldness.  The biotechnlogy company, based here, said the patent covers methods and chemical compounds that can be used to "solubilize" minoxidil and enhance penetration of the drug through the skin.  Minoxidil is marketed in the U.S. by Upjohn Co. under the brand name Rogaine.  The table in your July 25 and July 28 editorials showing that some 20% of the capital gains reported on 1985 tax returns came from people with less than $10,000 in wages and other ordinary income is highly misleading.  This category of tax returns includes returns with losses as well as positive income.  It is well known that most returns with negative income are filed by people with considerable wealth who can generate losses through the use of tax shelters and other tax-accounting devices.  The first column of the accompanying table, which is similar to yours except that it separates returns with net losses from those with positive incomes, shows that only 4.6% of reported capital gains came from people with other income of $1-$10,000.  Because your table classifies returns on the basis of income after the deduction of losses, it also understates the capital gains of high-income recipients.  When losses are added back to income (see the second column of the table), people with positive incomes of $75,000 or more accounted for 56.9% of reported capital gains rather than the 44.7% reported in your table.  Even this understates the concentration of capital gains among the wealthy because many of them have enough income to place them in the positive ranges even after the deduction of tax losses.  The simple truth is that low-income people don't own many assets on which to earn capital gains and that a capital-gains tax cut would be a bonanza for high-income people.  Joseph A.

(See related letter: "...for All Americans" -- WSJ Aug. 3, 1989)  The Japanese economy, according to the current consensus, is sound and its prospects bullish.  In a recent Gallup poll, twice as many Americans (58%) considered Japan to be "the world's leading economic power" as the U.S. When asked to assess the outlook for each country in the year 2000, a plurality of respondents continued to rate Japan ahead of the U.S., although the margin fell.  Among most U.S. Japanologists, there is even greater certainty.  Their prevailing view is that the Japanese economy will continue to move forward, smoothly and successfully, outdistancing the U.S. and Western Europe in the process.  The American business community's views are more ambivalent, although many in financial circles express similar judgments.  After all, the Japanese corporations listed on the Tokyo Exchange are worth, at current prices, 50% more than all of the U.S. corporations carried on the New York Stock Exchange.  There are, however, numerous reasons for disbelieving the consensus view.  The Japanese economy faces several significant risks in the years ahead -- risks that add up to a likely prospect of relative decline in Japan's position in the world economy during the next decade.  One risk is that the Tokyo stock market may crash in the next few years, perhaps by even more than the 20% drop of the New York exchange in October 1987.  The Nikkei index, now in the 34,000 range, has risen eightfold in the past decade, compared to a rise of less than 40% of that amount in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the same period.  Price-earnings ratios on the Tokyo market stand at about 55 to 1, compared to about 12 to 1, on the New York market.  But Tokyo's prices rest on a fragile foundation, because they are based on unsustainably high real estate values in the area environing Tokyo and other major cities.  Many Japanese corporations hold large amounts of urban land.  The extraordinary inflation of land prices in recent years -- Tokyo real estate has shot up by 200% since 1986 -- has inflated their balance sheets and therefore their stock prices.  Unfortunately for those firms' long-term prospects, the land scarcity is contrived, rather than real, a result of zoning restrictions originally intended to protect farmland from commercial development as part of the Japanese government's program to boost domestic rice production and achieve "food security."  But as the Japanese middle class becomes increasingly politically restive, a reaction already evident in the Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in the recent Upper House elections, those zoning restrictions are likely to be revised.  When that happens, urban land values will begin to dip, the balance sheets of land-holding companies will sag, and the Nikkei index and price-earnings ratios are likely to tumble.  The gradual decline of Japan's legendary saving rate is the second major reason economic clouds may darken the rising sun.  In the period from 1979 to 1984, Japan's private saving rate (household saving plus corporate saving as a ratio to private national income) exceeded that of the U.S. by nearly 11 percentage points -- 21.4% as against 10.6% -- and exceeded the OECD average by nearly 7%.  These large margins have fueled Japan's export-led growth by financing its investment in advanced technology at home, its accumulation of enormous assets abroad -- including over $400 billion in the U.S. -- and its present position as the principal source of capital in global financial markets.  This advantage may not last much longer.  According to a meticulous recent study by Professor Charles Horioka of Osaka University, two-thirds of the difference between the Japanese and U.S. savings rates can be explained by demographic factors: a lower ratio both of the aged (over 64) and of the young (under 19) to the working-age population.  Since these two nonworking age cohorts are generally dissavers, their relative absence from the Japanese population has tended to boost aggregate saving rates.  But Japan is aging.  The ratio of the aged to the working-age population is expected to rise from an average of 15% in the 1975-84 period to 27% by the year 2000.  The ratio of the non-working young will be even lower than it is now, but the young's numbers will not shrink fast enough to compensate for the proliferation of the old.  These demographic changes should produce a net lowering of the aggregate Japanese saving rate of 8.3% by the end of the century.  The U.S. rate should stay the same or even rise over those years.  Compounding the powerful effects of changing demographics, Japanese consumption propensities are also likely to rise across all segments of the population as they become increasingly familiar with higher living standards in the U.S. and Western Europe.  So the Japan of the 21st century may be expected to assume the role of a mature creditor country, importing more than it is exporting, and earning more from its foreign asset holdings than it is investing abroad to add to them.  Finally, the deep-seated mercantilist orientation of the Japanese economy will probably be buffeted by two strong forces in the international trade arena: formal and informal protectionism in the U.S. and European markets as well as the displacement of Japanese consumer durable products by competing lines from South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.  Indeed, the prospective liberalization of Japanese trade policy is more likely to accelerate penetration of the Japanese market by exports from these East Asian economies than by those from the U.S. and Western Europe.  Of course, the clouds over Japan's economic future may disperse.  Yet pessimism is at least as plausible as optimism.  While pessimistic forecasts of the relative economic decline of the U.S. have been widespread in recent years, in fact this scenario is more likely for Japan.  ---  Mr. Wolf directs RAND Corporation research in international economics and is dean of the RAND Graduate School.  A federal judge ruled that a shareholder's lawsuit against First RepublicBank Corp. can proceed as a class action on behalf of those who purchased stock after the 1987 merger of InterFirst Corp. and RepublicBank Corp.  In the suit, shareholders alleged they were misled as to the merged entity's financial stability by First RepublicBank and the investment banking firms of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc.  Less than a year after the merger, the banking concern sought federal financial assistance.  Its subsidiary banks were eventually taken over by federal regulators and sold to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C.  The holding company, First RepublicBank, then filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws.  GASOLINE PRICES quietly retreat after a much-publicized spring run-up.  Overestimates of summer driving led to excess output, refiners say.  Prices peaked in mid-May at a weighted average of $1.18 a gallon and are now at $1.13, says the Lundberg Survey.  "They could continue to drop in August," says Trilby Lundberg, president, especially if oil prices keep falling.  But sluggishly.  "Pump prices are fast to respond to rising prices but slower to fall when crude prices fall," says oil consultant Antonio Szabo of Bonner & Moore.  High-octane premium suffers the most because of a 20% price rise between January and May.  "People are experimenting to find out what {octane} they need," says Gordon H. Thomson, Exxon vice president.  Many drivers switch to midgrade gasolines, two to three octane points and about a dime a gallon lower.  But Amoco says premium, its most profitable gas, has stopped declining and predicts a rebound.  Though off a bit, high octane's top market is New York City, where 55.3% of sales are premium.  In Buffalo, drivers buy only 15.9% high-test.  CLEANLINESS COUNTS once motorists decide to make a pit stop.  They don't draw customers, but restrooms remain a major consideration in station design and operation.  The reason: Bad ones hurt the image.  "There's a tremendous don't: Don't let them get dirty," says Glenn Tilton, Texaco's marketing chief.  Ashland's SuperAmerica unit puts them inside for easier maintenance.  Texaco claims air dryers for hands improve hygiene and cut litter, while Amoco says people prefer paper towels.  A quick freshening for the car, too, gains popularity.  "Customers like to do as much as they can once they stop," says BP America senior vice president Hugh Hanna.  So BP seeks enough space at new sites to install car washes.  Free washes with a fill-up at Bill Roberts's Phillips 66 stations in Albuquerque pumped up gas sales 25%, he says.  Once built, washes cost operators only about 15 cents a car.  MARKETERS DEBATE what really attracts new gasoline customers.  "Clearly, price is No. 1," argues a senior vice president at price-cutter Atlantic Richfield.  "The American consumer realizes gasoline is a very fungible product, especially if it's from a major company."  But Shell Oil, the No. 1 seller, disagrees.  It aims to be competitive but not the cheapest on the block.  "There's a way to offer a whole package" that varies by location, claims Steve Miller, vice president.  The key is to cater to customers, Mr. Miller says, "which sounds easy but is incredibly difficult."  Amoco identifies 15 factors behind buying decisions, including gasoline quality, price, value, the station's appearance and location, says Bob McKeehan, general marketing manager.  Amoco and Shell are slowly and selectively boosting the number of stations that will repair cars.  Giveaways attract some drivers, but "a customer doesn't stay with you because of your promotions," Shell says.  CREDIT CARDS, scorned by some, are worth the trouble, says Texaco, which sells 31% of its gas to its holders.  Card users are loyal and buy expensive grades of gas and more impulse items.  Most limit themselves to two or three cards.  SOCIAL ISSUES and accidents don't sway gas choices much.  Despite a boycott effort, Exxon says buying habits "haven't substantially changed" since the Alaska spill.  Shell sees "no real effect" from protests over its presence in South Africa.  LEAD ISN'T DEAD, particularly west of the Rockies, where many pre-1975 cars remain alive.  Arco says 20% of West Coast drivers want leaded gasoline, though federal rules allow only a hint per gallon.  ENVIRONMENT PLAYS a bigger role, but the Brave New World has problems.  In New Jersey, where vapor-catching pump nozzles are being phased in, dealers tried seven generations of the devices to find a satisfactory one, claims Jerry Ferrara, an official of a gas retailers group.  "They're a pain in the neck," complains Jack Flanagan of Greentree Sunoco, Marlton.  "The hose pops out and squirts gasoline all over the place."  At Cherry Hill Mobil, Rich Angemi says the nozzles don't fit old cars.  Methanol gets good PR as clean fuel, but corrosive and toxic qualities require special handling.  "You can't see it, you can't smell it," says Arco, which sells it at a few pumps.  Plus, with less energy per gallon than gasoline, methanol requires frequent fill-ups or larger gas tanks.  Natural gas is clean, plentiful and politically popular, but in Holland, where many cars use it, compressing it in cars' tanks is a cumbersome process, says BP.  Oil firms insist gasoline isn't dead yet, saying new technology will make it the clean-burning "fuel of the future."  BRIEFS: The typical motorist buys 80% of his gas at same two stations, often competing brands, Ashland says. . . .  Are haircuts next?  In the store, a Texaco prototype station has seating for 12. . . .  BP says stations run by women are better-maintained, have improved bookkeeping, less theft and friendlier service. . . .  Amoco research shows 20% of customers like being called by name and premium buyers want free air.  At a cocktail reception, a longtime Democratic activist walks up to some journalists to ask the question.  At the Wall Street Journal lunch with political experts, top Republican political strategists ask it.  And on the ubiquitous weekend talk shows -- hotbeds of conventional wisdom -- it's raised repeatedly.  The question: "What's wrong with the Democrats?"  The nine months since the Democrats lost a presidential election for the fifth time in the past six outings (they had won seven of the previous nine) haven't been kind to the world's oldest political party:  -- The top Democratic officeholder, the speaker of the House, was drummed out of office following a pattern of sleazy activities.  -- The attractive new congressional Democratic leaders, George Mitchell in the Senate and Tom Foley in the House, are thoughtful but innately cautious, traits ill-suited to the premium that television places on the passions of the moment.  -- Even when the Democrats win, such as in rewriting George Bush's defense bill in the House last week, they look disjointed and chaotic.  By contrast, George Bush is riding high in the polls with popularity ratings larger -- on paper -- than Ronald Reagan's.  It seems like every week the Republican Party chairman, Lee Atwater, trots out a few more disaffected Democrats switching to the GOP; last week these ranged from Tommy Robinson, an erratic Arkansas congressman, to Maurice Turner, a respected, black, former police chief in Washington, D.C.  But most important, the Democrats are failing at two tasks a party must accomplish while trying to take back the White House: fashioning an effective counterpunch and offering a broad, even if vague, strategic sense of where it would like to take the country.  The Democrats, however, needn't turn over all the keys of government to the GOP quite yet.  The party continues to hold its own at every other level of government.  It has captured two of the three special House elections this year and is favored to win two of the three coming contests in Texas, California and Florida.  The Democratic candidate is favored to capture the New Jersey governorship, and, while a clear underdog, Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder, a black, has a shot at the Virginia statehouse.  "The Democrats still win most of the elections in this country," reminds Nelson Polsby, a University of California political scientist and an expert on political parties.  Moreover, the GOP's strength is enormously exaggerated.  George Bush's poll standings are the proverbial mile wide and inch deep; can anyone imagine Democrats so comfortable in voting against a President Reagan as they were in slapping down Mr. Bush's defense budget last week?  Every time Lee Atwater mentions another convert, it's instructive to remember Albert Watson, John Connally, Eugene Atkinson or some of those equally celebrated party-switchers of yesteryear.  Each time the conversion was hailed as the beginning of a watershed realignment; each time it turned out to be less than a water sprout.  What should disturb Democrats instead is their party's seeming reliance on a two-pronged strategy destined to fail: one is to wait for the Republicans to self-destruct, probably due to a severe recession; the other is to wait for issues to be handed to it -- the Supreme Court's abortion decision last month, the prime example.  To be sure, occasionally a party in power defaults.  The Democrats did that in 1968 and the Republicans did it following Watergate.  But these are the exceptions.  In 1982, the Republicans suffered through the deepest recession in 40 years; two years later, Ronald Reagan swept 49 states.  While the abortion debate plainly has shifted more favorably to the Democrats since the Supreme Court decision restricting abortions a month ago, this is a mercurial issue on the national level.  It isn't going to catapult the Democrats into the White House.  Two precedents are instructive: the Democrats' situation 30 years ago and the Republicans' a dozen years ago.  In both, the party out of power developed an effective counterpunch that led to some sense of where it wanted to lead the country.  In the late 1950s, the Democrats seized on Republican vulnerabilities on issues ranging from right-to-work laws to alleged missile gaps.  Jack Kennedy, while eschewing specifics, signaled the return of more activist federal government with promises to get the country moving again.  In the late 1970s, the Republicans impressively rebounded from Watergate by flailing away at Jimmy Carter on everything from political ineptitude in the White House to impotence abroad.  The Republican vision of the future was clear: lower taxes, a smaller deficit, less regulation and a more confrontational foreign policy.  But today, the Democrats should worry less about a specific platform.  "We have to become more adept at putting pressure on Bush and worry less about initiating our own agenda," says Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman. (The resignation this spring of House whip Tony Coelho, probably the party's best political strategist and counterpuncher, was an incalculable loss.) One of the problems, says GOP political analyst Kevin Phillips, is that the Democrats "lack any overview of the larger weaknesses of the Republican Party."  Curiously, the super-cautious Tom Foley may have discovered one of these weaknesses the past few weeks with his opposition to lowering the capital-gains tax rate.  The Republican argument that this is an issue settled in the 1988 presidential campaign -- with George Bush for a lower rate and Michael Dukakis against -- is revisionism.  The only time Mike Dukakis made a mild comeback in last year's race was when he started attacking the Bush proposal on cutting capital gains taxes.  By contrast, George Bush didn't once mention the capital gains tax-cut proposal in the final 10 days of the campaign.  This epitomizes an issue of fairness that provides Democrats with some counterpunches against the Bush administration and possibly a sense of where they would like to take the country.  But this has to be constructed carefully.  There clearly is a populist sentiment in the country.  But it can't be backward-looking and it can't be defeatist.  Two undeniable traits in the American political psyche are a "can-do" spirit and an eagerness to look ahead.  Again, the Democrats in the late 1950s and the Republicans 20 years later understood that.  Thus, Democrats make a mistake in focusing on the minimum wage as a major battleground.  Tradition and constituency groups require that they approve a minimum-wage increase, but it's no centerpiece for a Democratic revival.  Similarly, pure protectionism works well for Democrats in some congressional districts.  But it flops as a national issue; it's backward-looking and defeatist.  That doesn't mean the Democrats can't embrace a tougher trade posture; many Americans, who love their Sonys and Hyundais, still think we're being played for a sucker by other countries.  For all the criticism of the congressionally imposed club to use against unfair trade practices abroad -- the so-called Super 301 -- it's already enjoyed some early success; the South Koreans, for instance, reduced some of their trade barriers to head off this club.  That's a good issue for the Democrats and is more forward-looking than some of the pure protectionism pabulum.  There are a number of other quasi-populist issues where the Democrats can score points against George Bush and stitch together some sense of direction for the country.  These include child care and health care, education, some environmental issues and even taxes, as long as the taxes don't seem aimed to hit the middle-income taxpayer to pay for social programs for the poor.  Another potential plus for the Democrats should be ethics, despite the problems of Jim Wright.  The current HUD scandal and the sense that the Reagan years created special favors for the privileged provide a clear opening.  But when President Bush proposed a modest campaign-finance overhaul measure, including a diminished role for special-interest political-action committees, some Democrats, including party chairman Ron Brown, howled.  That's the sort of reaction that breeds the question: "What's wrong with the Democrats?" ---  Mr. Hunt is the Journal's Washington bureau chief.  Boeing Co., unveiling still more of the Stealth bomber's long-held secrets, disclosed that it has performed $4 billion of work on the B-2 aircraft.  The Seattle-based aerospace company said it has built key structural parts for the radar-eluding plane, including the aft and outboard sections of the flying wing, the fuel system, the weapons delivery system and the landing gear.  The disclosure basically confirms the conjecture of B-2 enthusiasts, who have long made a guessing game of what each major Stealth subcontractor is responsible for manufacturing.  Northrop Corp. is the prime contractor on the plane, and at least 156 other companies have a role in putting it together.  "We've wanted to tell what we did for a long time," a Boeing spokesman said, adding that Los Angeles-based Northrop passed on word from Air Force officials earlier this week that it was finally all right to declare the information.  With the B-2's price tag under increasing scrutiny on Capitol Hill, more and more information on the plane is being declassified in a last-ditch sales effort by the Pentagon.  Boeing said about 10,000 of its employees are working on the Stealth, 80% of them from the company's advanced systems subsidiary.  This unit, which has a total of 11,000 employees, also is working on a high-altitude, unmanned aircraft, dubbed the Condor, and on the Air Force's next-generation tactical fighter jet, as part of a team that includes Lockheed Corp., Calabasas, Calif., and General Dynamics Corp., St. Louis.  Separately, Boeing confirmed that it has received subpoenas to hand over corporate documents in two unrelated federal investigations.  One stems from allegations by a former Boeing employee that the company overcharged and double-billed the Defense Department for repairs of buildings leased for military work.  The spokesman said Boeing is cooperating with Air Force investigators.  The other subpoena relates to a long-running investigation of the defense industry's unauthorized attainment of secret Pentagon planning data.  The Boeing spokesman explained that this is separate from "Operation Ill Wind," the government's inquiry into influence-peddling among defense contractors and consultants.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing shares closed at $50.50, down 50 cents.  The House approved a $138 billion labor, health and education bill that provides for continued growth in AIDS research and a more than 20% increase in federal aid for low-income public school children in elementary grades.  Second in size only to the Pentagon budget, the massive bill represents a 9% increase from current levels in total funding for the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education departments, and adds $4.2 billion to the administration's requests for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.  Final passage on a 368-58 roll call came as the Democratic-controlled chamber narrowly upheld an Appropriations Committee bid to roll back current abortion restrictions attached to a lesser spending measure for the Washington, D.C., government.  The 219-206 vote was a victory for pro-abortion forces, and though the language applies only to the capital city, the debate had national significance in the aftermath of the recent Supreme Court decision upholding curbs on abortion.  "It's a big no vote," said Rep. Charles Rose (D., N.C.).  "The people back home may not be as happy as some thought with the Supreme Court decision."  Though within spending ceilings set by the April budget summit, the labor, education and health bill leaves little room to finance promised child-care initiatives in the next fiscal year.  An estimated $2 billion in appropriations is held in reserve, but the margin is far smaller for outlays or direct spending under the budget.  In education accounts, compensatory aid to public school districts is increased by more than 20% from current levels to $5.58 billion.  But budget pressures restricted growth in financial assistance for college students.  Student-loan funding is cut by 10% from current levels and, while some increase is provided for Pell Grants to low-income college students, recent estimates indicate a shortfall of nearly $400 million in funding for this account.  The same fiscal pressure could have an impact on the final disposition of funding for research and treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  The House measure assumes a 25% increase, bringing total appropriations to nearly $1.6 billion for these accounts.  But more discretion is given to federal agencies in how the money is actually allocated.  This change in budgeting is most important within the National Institutes of Health, which is slated to receive the largest single share -- $752.6 million -- for AIDS research.  Not including these AIDS funds, the NIH growth would be held to less than 6%, reducing its ability to finance new research grants.  By now subjecting the AIDS-related biomedical research to a peer-review process, the House bill also makes it vulnerable to being diverted to meet competing needs -- an outcome worrisome to gay activists.  The District of Columbia appropriations bill is dwarfed by the larger health and education measure but it draws heated debate nonetheless as an annual battleground on abortion.  Last night's vote rolled back a House decision last year extending anti-abortion language to city funds covered under the bill, and the symmetry between the two roll calls offered insight into the changing politics of the issue.  "Political safety is on the pro-choice side now," said Rep. Les AuCoin (D., Ore.) after the vote, and 24 more Democrats sided against the prohibitions than a year ago.  Federal funding for abortion remains severely limited, and the issue is clouded by the concern of lawmakers about intruding on local government.  The legislative impact may be less important than the insurgent mood among pro-abortion forces; the Capitol hallway off the House floor was filled with cheering women lobbyists who had organized against the restrictions.  Trading on the Chicago exchanges took a back seat to the spectacle of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, FBI Director William Sessions and CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm jetting out to join U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas to announce 46 indictments.  Their enthusiasm notwithstanding, someone needs to put the allegations in perspective.  Crimes may have been committed, but when we heard "RICO" we trebled the usual presumption of innocence.  The sting at the lively Chicago Board of Trade and Mercantile Exchange -- apparently triggered by competitors of the targeted traders -- has been curious from the start.  News broke last winter when federal agents rapped on front doors at midnight to demand that traders either cop a plea and testify against others or lose their cars and jewelry on the spot under the pre-trial asset-seizure provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.  Sentence first, trial later.  Whatever the alleged crimes, these tactics violated the Justice Department's own guidelines prohibiting RICO threats "solely or even primarily to create a bargaining tool."  Coerced pleas under these circumstances raise credibility problems.  Another problem with RICO is that it's hard to discover the alleged wrongdoing when the Attorney General joins a claim that dozens of trading operations are "racketeering enterprises."  Indeed, whatever the accused may have done, prosecutors risk undermining the integrity of markets and the legal system by invoking RICO's broad "fraud" allegations instead of sticking to specific claims under commodities laws.  Some traders are accused of nothing more criminal than trading after the closing bell.  Others may have bought or sold without telling their customers that they were on the other side of the deal, clearly a serious deception.  One problem with RICO is that traders charged with rather trivial offenses are lumped under one indictment, can have all their assets frozen and stand trial with others accused of serious offenses.  Charges of rigged trades are certainly worth investigating, but we note that unlike the broader New York and American stock exchanges, futures trading involves sophisticated parties.  These customers are unlikely to have made Chicago the futures capital of the world if they had thought trade rigging a common practice.  Before RICO, prosecutors would have exercised some discretion about whether the general efficiency of the market was so endangered that criminal prosecution was needed.  Exhibit A of how RICO tempts prosecutors to substitute an undefined charge of racketeering for serious thought about how markets actually work is the Princeton/Newport case, where several securities officials were convicted this week.  The prosecutors said the firm had engaged in fraudulent trades aimed at evading taxes, but relied on RICO's notoriously broad "predicate acts" of mail fraud and wire fraud, not sections of the tax code.  Indeed, the IRS admits the firm in fact overpaid its taxes.  Still, it's not totally surprising that the jury convicted.  Juries in this country are usually entitled to trust that prosecutors have brought allegations of an actual crime.  With RICO, a vague accusation of "sleaze" is enough.  This is one reason four Supreme Court Justices said this term that RICO may well be unconstitutionally vague.  The entire concept of the rule of law requires clear criminal statutes, defining with precision what behavior is permitted and what is not.  Chicago traders may be guilty of something, but the one certainty is that RICO is a lousy way to discover what.  Two members of the American Stock Exchange were disciplined for violating exchange rules or Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.  Charles Benwitt of Stamford, Conn., was fined for improperly managing the prices of securities in his specialist unit.  Jack Shuman, president of Jack Shuman Associates Inc. here, was disciplined on a number of counts, including failure to supply the exchange with SEC-required documents and failure to pay previous fines.  According to the Amex, Mr. Benwitt paid $15,000 and was suspended from the exchange for 10 days.  He settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Mr. Benwitt was unavailable for comment.  Mr. Shuman was fined $10,000, in addition to a $7,500 fine levied earlier.  He and his company were barred from exchange membership until the fines are paid.  He couldn't be reached for comment.  Money market mutual fund yields retreated more than 1/10th of a percentage point in the week ended Tuesday.  The average seven-day compounded yield, for example, slipped to 8.84% from 8.97% a week ago, according to Donoghue's Money Markets.  The Holliston, Mass., newsletter surveys 382 taxable funds.  "Nothing we have seen in the money fund activity this week was unexpected," said Donoghue editor Susan Cook.  Yields fell, while average maturity and assets increased, she said.  Yields on the funds have slipped each week since the week of May 16, although at a slower pace than interest rates on many of the investments in their portfolios.  The seven-day compounded yield has fallen 74/100ths of a percentage point from 9.58% in mid-May.  Meantime, the yield of a typical six-month certificate of deposit has dropped slightly more than one percentage point, to 7.95%.  In addition, 90-day commercial paper of Citicorp, a major issuer, has declined 1 1/4 percentage points to about 8.06%.  Treasury bills have also retreated in the last 2 1/2 months.  Fund managers continue to take steps to limit their exposure to the overall interest rate decline by extending the maturity of their portfolios and holding issues with more favorable interest rates for increased lengths of time.  In the latest week, according to Donoghue's, the average fund maturity edged up one day to 42.  In the week of May 16, average maturity was 36 days.  Despite slumping yields, investors are still interested in money funds, and cash has continued to pour into them.  In the week ended Tuesday, assets jumped $3.8 billion to a record $327.8 billion.  Donoghue's said that weekly increases have usually been around the $2.5 billion level.  This week, most of the increase was concentrated in the institutional-type funds, which added $2.1 billion.  The 30-day compounded yield on money funds fell to 9.02% from 9.11%.  Compounding assumes that dividends will be reinvested and that yields will remain the same for one year.  The average seven-day simple yield fell to 8.47% from 8.60%, and the 30-day simple yield dropped to 8.64% from 8.73%.  A federal appeals court said that most of the $11.5 million of the assets disgorged by Dennis Levine to settle Securities and Exchange Commission insider-trading charges can be used to pay taxes owed to the U.S.  But the appeals court rejected Mr. Levine's claim that the disgorged assets could also be used to pay his criminal fines.  Mr. Levine pleaded guilty in June 1985 to insider trading, perjury and income-tax evasion.  He was sentenced to four concurrent two-year prison terms and was fined $362,000.  The appeals court said that the Internal Revenue Service is entitled to payment of about $8.5 million.  That amount is for a lien that the IRS filed against Mr. Levine before the SEC settlement was reached.  The court said that federal and state tax claims assessed after the settlement couldn't be paid from the assets.  The tax liabilities are based on Mr. Levine's profit on allegedly unlawful stock transactions from 1980 to 1985.  The court said none of the $3.3 million disgorged by Robert M. Wilkis, also a former investment banker here, could be used to pay taxes.  Mr. Wilkis agreed to the disgorgement in June 1986, also to settle SEC charges of insider trading.  The appeals court said the disgorged assets of Mr. Wilkis can't be used to cover taxes because the taxes were assessed after the money was disgorged.  Mr. Wilkis pleaded guilty in December 1986 to insider trading, mail fraud, income-tax evasion and failure to report certain money transactions.  He was sentenced to prison and probation.  The court upheld most of a federal district judge's decision on how the disgorged assets were to be used.  The lower court had said, however, that the IRS wasn't entitled to collect taxes from the disgorged assets on the ground that the assets were obtained by wrongful means.  U.S. District Judge Richard Owen had ordered that the assets be earmarked for defrauded investors.  But the appeals court said the assets couldn't go to defrauded investors because Messrs.  Levine and Wilkis gave up the assets "without admitting or denying the allegations."  Although the men later admitted to criminal insider trading, their guilty plea didn't apply to the vast majority of the insider-trading accusations covered by the SEC settlement, the court said.  Mr. Levine's attorney, Arthur L. Liman, didn't return calls seeking comment.  Marvin E. Frankel, attorney for Mr. Wilkis, said he hadn't yet read the court's decision and was unable to comment.  The great debate now unfolding over the Clean Air bill reminds us a lot of commercials for laundry detergent -- those wonderful products that promised to make your clothes "cleaner than clean" and "whiter than white."  Consider the critique of the Bush clean-air bill by California's Rep. Henry Waxman.  He and his allies are fuming because the President's plan would reduce ozone emissions, a component of urban smog, by 2.5% a year, instead of the 3% a year in an earlier version of the bill.  Sulfur-dioxide emissions would be reduced by nine million tons by 2001, instead of 10 million tons.  Is this really to suggest that people will get sick if sulfur dioxide is reduced by nine million rather than 10 million tons?  In short, what do these numbers have to do with the public's health?  In fact, nobody knows.  Scientists are far from understanding how emissions translate into air quality or how air quality affects public health.  The logical question, then, is why are public officials exerting so much energy over a policy with such uncertain benefits?  The blunt and amazing answer is that nobody is particularly concerned about public health as most people understand it.  The terms of the environmental debate have shifted.  Under the Clean Air Act of 1970, it was considered sensible to construct an environmental policy on a cost-benefit basis.  As chemicals were shown with reasonable confidence to be dangerous, their use would be restricted depending on cost and the degree of health danger.  But that sensible method doesn't lend itself to clean-air crusades.  Congress, for instance, ordered the EPA to control 300 chemicals, but the agency has regulated only seven, because it can't determine that the rest pose a significant risk.  In a sense, environmentalism today is primarily a political phenomenon.  Sympathetic news stories fan public fears and the public fans the politicians.  Thus, to produce "bold" initiatives the Bush administration and Congress decided to disregard the current state of scientific knowledge, whose uncertain status is seen as inhibiting action of any sort.  This tactic was expressed succinctly in Newsweek: "The most effective environmental standards are based on what's technologically feasible, not on arcane estimates of potential health hazards."  In other words, do what you can and don't worry about why you are doing it.  Accordingly, Mr. Bush's clean-air bill, credited to EPA head William Reilly, guarantees no specific public-health benefits.  Indeed, the President himself acknowledged the initiative's liberation from the constraints of real science by declaring that the "time for study has passed."  Moreover, politicians have claimed carte blanche when it comes to environmental spending.  The 1970 Clean Air Law now costs about $35 billion annually, costs borne by consumers.  The Bush bill would add at least an additional $20 billion to that.  In its favor, the President's bill sets an important precedent for flexibility; for sulfur-dioxide emissions industries could meet standards in their own ways.  Some bills, such as Rep. Waxman's, almost certainly would be more expensive and rely on authoritarian command-and-control techniques left over from the industry-bashing ethos of the early '70s.  Now, it is entirely possible that Americans at some point should commit themselves to spending billions of dollars from their earned incomes to make the air cleaner.  It's not so evident, though, that the nation's wage earners should be asked to make what is currently a kind of secular leap of faith because the environmental movement has become frustrated with science's inability to prove its case.  Indeed, there'd be a lot more rationality in this debate if we had a more competent community of environmental scientists.  Currently, the environmental sciences are at low ebb.  Few of the best young scientific minds enter the field, and many others leave for more prestigious and lucrative areas.  The current primitive understanding of air pollution is what makes possible the hysterical rhetoric that has become the lingua franca of the environmental community.  But the little hard evidence that does exist shows that the air has been getting cleaner since 1970.  The fact that the U.S. has made real progress on its air, and that most of the country is not in a state of crisis, suggests a number of more sensible strategies.  Improve the science with funding for individual researchers (rather than the handful of consultants who now dominate this field).  Commit valuable economic resources to public-health problems that we actually understand.  Keep in mind that it won't be possible to "solve" long-term ecosystem trends in time for the next electoral cycle or tonight's TV news.  Most important, don't join the hysterics.  Much of the current debate ignores all those strategies, especially the latter.  At potluck dinners the guests bring a dish and everyone plows through a meal having no rhyme or reason.  So it goes with Congress's handling of this year's defense bill.  The House bill is filled with constricting amendments and arms-control ideas that make the measure look like lime Jell-O salad.  Yesterday the Senate produced one acceptable item -- support for anti-satellite tests -- but also turned out its own follies: It wants the Pentagon to report on how to rescue the hostages, and it voted down an interceptor system that would protect the U.S. from a terrorist missile attack.  Steven Soderbergh is only 26 years old, so it isn't surprising that this film director seems to have spent a great deal of time thinking about women.  What's surprising is how astutely he's thought about them.  Ann and Cynthia, the two female characters in his first feature film, "sex, lies and videotape," aren't particularly virtuous or villainous.  They are, however, by far the most vital women to appear onscreen in a long while.  This movie about Relationships ripples with an exquisitely understated erotic charge and an intense, proficient style.  But it may be in danger of being overwhelmed by the advance praise that's been heaped on it.  Critics began the ballyhoo in May, when the picture won top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and one of its players, James Spader, won best actor.  The hype seems vulgar and outsized for a movie whose considerable virtues center on an engaging intimacy, and wryness of tone.  The film has a terrific fresh and funny beginning.  You hear a melodic, Southern woman's voice talking about garbage -- what to do with all of it? -- and other global questions.  The voice, hesitant and self-deprecating, rambles on to the more specific topics of her husband and sex and the annoying prospect of an unexpected guest.  Then you see her, a beautiful woman, about 30, sitting on a comfortable couch, directing her conversation to her therapist.  As she talks, Mr. Soderbergh introduces the movie's four main characters almost as illustrations for the as-yet-anonymous woman's monologue.  She is Ann, a model of well-bred, upper-middle-class repression, living in Baton Rouge, La. (Mr.  Soderbergh's hometown).  When her therapist asks her about masturbation, she blushes so hard she shakes ("No, no, no, no," is her response).  Her distracted ruminations are an updated version of many literary neurotic Southern ladies, only Ann is of the New South, less exotic and very amusing in a bittersweet way.  "Being happy isn't all that great," she tells her shrink.  When she was happy, she recalls, "I got so fat."  The therapist isn't doing Ann any good.  She's living a life nearly empty of sex and full of hypocrisy.  Her husband John, on the other hand, maintains a balance of sex and hypocrisy: He has plenty of both. (He lies to his wife and sleeps with her sister.) The fourth main character is an old college friend of John's, an artistic vagabond who has given up on both sex and lies, or so he thinks.  He's turned to videotape to guard his purity.  He doesn't sleep with women, he has them talk to his camera about sex.  He doesn't live life, he watches it on film.  Mr. Soderbergh is young enough to keep up a good head of rage at the idea of hypocrisy, that human beings aren't completely honest with one another.  Yet for the most part he conducts his probe into feelings, a potentially mawkish swamp, with deft humor and compassion -- especially for the women.  When music is used sparsely, ordinary sounds seem heightened.  In this atmosphere of hyperreality the audience is made to feel voyeuristic.  There is a feeling of ripeness in the air.  Mr. Soderbergh keeps the sexual tension at a high level by letting the viewer in on the seduction, but never showing the actual event.  Andie MacDowell, far more memorable for her saucy role in Calvin Klein jeans ads than for her movie parts ("Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes," "St.  Elmo's Fire"), startles with her portrayal of Ann, she is that good.  Though much of what you know about Ann comes from how she looks and how her house looks -- you know she must religiously read House & Garden and order kitchen gadgets from Williams-Sonoma -- Ms. MacDowell makes her hurt heartbreakingly real.  She's stuck, simply unaware that there might be something even more comfortable than perfection.  Laura San Giacomo, a stage and television actress making a memorably keen film debut here, plays Cynthia, Ann's sister.  It's obvious that long ago Cynthia decided if Ann was a good girl, she, Cynthia, must be bad.  Mr. Soderbergh acknowledges the competition between the sisters in his script, but he almost doesn't have to.  You get it just looking at them, and listening to them.  Taking his cue from Calvin's marketing people, Mr. Soderbergh makes eloquent use of the tight closeup.  The elegantly voluptuous Ann exudes pureness; a cross always dangles around her neck.  Cynthia is little and skinny but intensely sexual; she tends bar in a seedy joint and has a voice sandpapered to a growl by cigarettes.  Her affair with John, Ann's husband, is straightforward: a cynical mix of lust and revenge.  But Cynthia's no more honest than Ann, no less trapped by the person she's determined herself to be.  The male characters, smartly played by Peter Gallagher and James Spader, are more problematic, though they move the story forward.  Mr. Gallagher, a darkly sensuous man, hasn't had a movie part as juicy as John since he played a Fabian-like rock 'n' roller in "The Idolmaker" nearly a decade ago.  With John, a smug young lawyer, what you see is all there is.  Even his cleaner-than-clean white shirts radiate a satisfied sense of well-being.  He's pragmatic, does only what he has to.  When Cynthia suggests there isn't anything to their relationship but sex, he barely tries to argue with her.  He doesn't feel obligated to lie to her the way he lies to Ann.  But you get the sense right from the beginning that John exists only to be shot down.  He's too much a type, too much the shallow yuppie blithely having it all.  His connection to Ann is so tenuous that there isn't any snap when it breaks.  The movie's strongest and weakest point is the drifter called Graham (James Spader).  He's the obvious contrast to John, not overtly sensual at all, he looks peachy, like a boy who hasn't started to shave yet.  Ann doesn't know what to make of him when he shows up at her house, wearing black shirt and jeans and displaying no working knowledge of adult chit-chat.  Instead, he disarms her by asking her, very directly, the kinds of intimate questions she's used to hearing only from her shrink; for example, what do you think of marriage?  Orderly Ann can't help but be drawn to this enigmatic stranger, especially after he confides that he's impotent.  He's a safe fantasy object, sexless, and just perfect as a surrogate therapist who makes house calls.  Graham is, more importantly, the emblem of this movie's main, though not terribly profound message -- that voyeurs (therapists, video artists and, apparently, married ladies) aren't really living.  To make the point, Mr. Soderbergh has to unmask Graham, to force him to reveal to Ann why he likes to watch.  Graham, unfortunately, is a Lake Erie of a person; looks deep, is shallow.  When Ann turns the video camera on him, what he has to say about himself is disappointing.  Much as Mr. Soderbergh seems to disdain psychoanalysts, he's fed Graham psychobabble to burble about why he behaves the way he does.  Murmuring about a "sense of closure" he seems dull and pathetic.  Mr. Soderbergh's confusion about Graham probably reflects some confusion about himself (he has said that the movie was inspired by a disappointing love affair he once had).  The director is young and extremely talented, so it's likely that next time he'll make an even better film than this exciting first effort.  Maybe he'll feel confident enough to capitalize the title.  ---  VIDEO TIP: Film makers are naturally drawn to the idea of filming their lives instead of living them.  Check out Brian De Palma's delightfully eccentric 1980 comedy, "Home Movies," about a teen-ager who's tired of playing the extra in life, and wants to be a star.  Proving that there's life after Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., financier Michael Milken has emerged as a key strategist in a plan to bail out Weintraub Entertainment Group.  The closely held, ailing film and entertainment concern has hired Mr. Milken to assist its investment banker, Bear Stearns & Co., in devising a plan to pump in capital, spokesmen for WEG and Mr. Milken confirmed.  Mr. Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk-bond operation, was indicted in March on 98 criminal counts, including racketeering, securities fraud and tax fraud.  The arrangement represents the first publicly disclosed deal involving Mr. Milken since he resigned from Drexel in June to form International Capital Access Group, a Los Angeles-based firm whose self-discribed mission is to "provide advice and other assistance to individuals, communities and companies," particularly employees, minorities and unions.  Mr. Milken didn't have any clients signed on with his new firm when he left Drexel, and the financier has been mum since then on who he is working for.  The association with WEG comes at a time when the company, battered by a string of box-office flops, is fraying at the edges.  The company acknowledged yesterday that it missed a July 30 interest payment of around $5 million on around $81 million outstanding of subordinated debentures.  It said it is working out a plan to pay the interest within 30 days of the due date, to avert a default.  While still at Drexel, Mr. Milken had tried to persuade the firm to handle the WEG bond issue, but Drexel wouldn't follow through.  Bear Stearns ultimately handled the private placement of the 13% bonds in 1987.  In addition to Bear Stearns, WEG has retained investment banking firms in Europe and Japan.  After six straight movie flops, WEG has only one film left to release and none in production.  The company reported losses of $40.9 million in 1988, and was down to $9.7 million in cash last April.  In 1988, interest expenses were reported to be $16.7 million.  But the company insists that it is on the verge of a transaction that will change its fortunes.  "There is major activity," a spokesman for WEG said.  Since the beginning of the year, WEG has been looking at various alternatives to infuse capital and service its debt.  There were talks with Viacom Inc. and with Giancarlo Paretti, the Italian financier who owns Pathe Entertainment Inc. WEG has also held discussions with New York investor Stephen Swid, who has capital to expand his film interests following sale of his 50% stake in SBK Entertainment World Inc. SBK was acquired in June by Thorn EMI for $308 million.  WEG's major asset is perhaps its large film library, which the company bought for $89 million from Cannon Group Inc., the predecessor to Pathe.  WEG executives say the library has appreciated substantially since the purchase.  The company reportedly has held discussions with Warner Communications Inc.'s film division about releasing future WEG films.  In the past, Columbia Pictures Entertainment had distributed WEG films.  Gump's, the San Francisco retailer, named as its chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth W. Watson, luring him from Cartier Inc., where he was president and chief executive.  In June, Gump's was acquired from Macmillan Inc. by a joint venture of Charterhouse Group International, a New York investment concern, and Tobu Department Store Co., a Tokyo retailer.  Mr. Watson is also a shareholder of the new Gump's entity.  Mr. Watson, who joined Cartier in 1985, will begin his new position Sept. 5, Gump's said.  Cartier International, the Paris parent of Cartier Inc., said that Pierre Haquet, general manager of the Paris concern, will manage U.S. operations until a successor has been named to Mr. Watson.  During the interim period, Cartier said, Ralph Destino, chairman of Cartier Inc., will work with Mr. Haquet on managing day-to-day operations in the U.S.  Advertising agencies are used to difficult clients, but sometimes you have to draw the line.  Taylor-Gordon, Aarons & Co. isn't going to take it any more from Leona Helmsley.  Yesterday, the ad agency resigned the Helmsley Hotel Corp. account and held an unusual news conference to vent its frustrations.  Normally, ad agencies don't hold news briefings to announce they're losing an account, especially when it only bills $5 million.  But Mrs. Helmsley, currently on trial on charges of evading federal income taxes, is an unusual case.  The Manhattan hotelier, dubbed "The Queen" in ads for her hotels, is the center of a local media circus prompted by testimony from sundry Helmsley executives, maids and contractors that she was one hell of a tough boss.  Local television stations are airing regular updates of juicy testimony portraying Mrs. Helmsley as a model of wickedness.  At the news conference, Elaine Taylor-Gordon, the New York-based agency's president, jumped on the bandwagon.  Looking directly at the TV cameras, she described a tumultuous agency-client relationship in which Mrs. Helmsley would often jump up and take charge of meetings.  "Move that type]" Mrs. Helmsley would often shout when proofing a print advertisement, Ms. Taylor-Gordon said.  The agency's creative director, Larry Aarons, said Mrs. Helmsley's style was "Lift that bale.  Tote that barge."  Ms. Taylor-Gordon also described a recent business meeting in which she was summoned to the Helmsley Palace Hotel.  Mrs. Helmsley had a martini.  Ms. Taylor-Gordon had an antacid.  "She told me, 'Don't get comfortable.  You're not here for a social event,'" Ms. Taylor-Gordon said.  Mrs. Helmsley and other designated spokesmen didn't return phone calls seeking comment.  Although the trial has been a public-relations disaster for Mrs. Helmsley, the hotel company's advertising hasn't changed.  The Queen, shown beaming, still figures prominently in almost all of the company's ads.  A recent print ad for the New York Helmsley Hotel shows a bathroom vanity with a tray full of amenities.  The copy: "Perfect.  But not to Leona Helmsley.  Can you see why?" (Answer: there's only one toothbrush on the guest tray, not two.)  "We have become targets -- almost pariahs -- to our peers, who have jumped into the fray to trash and attack the account for their own self-aggrandizement," Ms. Taylor-Gordon said, referring to widespread criticism of the quality of the ads in the advertising trade.  Executives at the agency defended their work, saying it helped raised occupancy rates at all of the hotels to all-time highs; the agency has serviced the account since 1986.  But the final straw came in June, with the news that Mrs. Helmsley planned to cut the agency's commissions by more than two-thirds, Ms. Taylor-Gordon said.  She said Mrs. Helmsley told her "she needed the money."  There's hardly a client alive who can't find an agency somewhere to take his money, but it remains to be seen how much interest the hotel chain will be able to drum up on Madison Avenue.  A quick check yesterday among top executives suggested there are a number who won't be pitching.  "I would truly be astonished if any good agency would take her business," said Roy Grace, chairman of ad agency Grace & Rothschild.  "No interest," said Don Peppers, executive vice president at Lintas: New York.  "Whoever it is, I'm going to send them a supply of Maalox and Advil," said Ms. Taylor-Gordon.  ---  Ad Notes. . . .   WHO'S NEWS: Ricardo C. Calvillo, 49, was named president of Calet, Hirsch & Spector, New York, a unit of the Ross Roy Group.  As president, Mr. Calvillo will share executive responsibility with Co-Chairmen Neil Calet and Peter Hirsch.  Taiwanese investor Fred C. Lee agreed to pay $25.15 million in penalties and disgorgement as part of a settlement of civil insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  However, the deal with Mr. Lee leaves largely unsettled an important issue raised earlier in the year by the SEC's vigorous pursuit of his assets: whether a U.S. agency has the right to seize assets from foreign bank accounts.  Mr. Lee's settlement is the third-largest in SEC history.  In 1986, Ivan F. Boesky, who also pleaded guilty to an insider-trading related charge, paid $100 million to the SEC.  In 1987, Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of General Electric Co., paid $25.3 million to settle charges of insider trading and other securities-law violations.  In its civil complaint filed last year, the SEC alleged that from 1987 to early 1988, Mr. Lee traded on inside information supplied by Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., a former analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co.  The SEC charged the scheme made more than $19 million in illegal profits.  Mr. Wang pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to related criminal charges and is serving a three-year prison term.  Earlier this year, he settled civil insider-trading charges filed by the SEC by agreeing to disgorge $127,600 in allegedly illegal profits.  In settling, Mr. Wang neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.  Mr. Lee's settlement with the SEC, in which he too admits no wrongdoing, doesn't involve a parallel deal with the Justice Department over any possible criminal charges.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on whether he will be indicted.  Mr. Lee, a Taiwan national who has lived in Hong Kong and the U.S., is currently in Taiwan.  The U.S. has no extradition treaties with Taiwan, according to the State Department, so it's unlikely Mr. Lee would ever stand trial, if indicted, so long as he remained in Taiwan.  "We are fully satisfied with the settlement," said Thomas C. Newkirk, the chief enforcement litigator for the SEC in Washington.  "It provides for the disgorgement of the full amount we sought {more than $19 million} plus a penalty of more than $1.5 million, plus it provides for payment of $4.5 million in taxes and penalties."  Lawyers close to the case said the money to pay the SEC was coming from Mr. Lee's bank and brokerage accounts in the U.S., which had been frozen, and funds he has in five banks accounts at a Hong Kong branch of Standard Chartered Bank PLC. Also, Mr. Lee's holdings in two limited partnerships that invest in leveraged buy-out funds had to be sold.  Lawyers said the funds were managed by Morgan Stanley & Co. and Tullis-Cook & Co., a Greenwich, Conn., investment-banking firm.  Yesterday's settlement leaves unclear the extent to which the SEC can pursue suspected violators of U.S. securities laws overseas.  Last August, the SEC obtained an order from a federal judge mandating that London-based Standard Chartered turn over about $12.5 million to the court.  The agency contended that some of the funds, which were deposited in a Standard Chartered branch in Hong Kong, might be the insider-trading profits of Mr. Lee.  Lawyers said the case was unprecedented because the bank -- which hadn't been accused of any wrongdoing -- was being forced to hand over funds while still being liable under Hong Kong law for returning the money to its depositors.  In its appeal of the order, Standard Chartered was joined by the British government, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and several foreign bankers associations.  Britain filed a diplomatic protest with the U.S. State Department.  The New York Fed warned that if the ruling stood, depositors and investors might steer clear of banks with U.S. branches, and that such behavior could erode "the central role of the U.S. in world financial markets."  Others argued that the judge's order could damage the competitive position of U.S. banks.  As part of the settlement, the court returned about $13.2 million to Standard Chartered, an amount equal to the $12.5 million it had turned over, plus interest.  The bank also received $300,000 toward its expenses of litigating the case in both New York and Hong Kong.  Before agreeing to drop its appeal, Standard Chartered insisted that the return of funds be structured legally in an effort to prevent the judge's initial order from standing as a precedent.  "It was essential that we demonstrate that this should not stand as a precedent," said John Dickey, a partner at the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, which represents the bank.  "The structure of this settlement combined with the $300,000 payment will provide strong support to any bank in a similar position to Standard Chartered's should the SEC try this again.  It constitutes recognition by the SEC that they went too far."  Mr. Dickey added that half of the $300,000 Standard Chartered received would otherwise have been paid to the SEC.  That the SEC gave up $150,000, he contended, further indicates that the agency was mistaken in the course it pursued.  Nonetheless, Mr. Newkirk of the SEC said the settlement "absolutely would not" deter the agency from using similar tactics in the future.  He added: "The sequestration order accomplished exactly what we wanted it to do: It protected the assets and kept Lee from succeeding in his efforts to get them in Hong Kong."

CML Group Inc., which investor Irwin Jacobs has said he might seek to acquire, announced several restructuring moves that will result in a loss for its recently ended fiscal year but should improve future earnings.  The power-boat builder and specialty retailer said it will pay off a contract with the former owners of its NordicTrack subsidiary in a lump sum.  As a result, it will take a $36 million charge and report a loss of $13 million to $17 million for its recently ended fiscal year.  For the year ended July 31, 1988, CML reported net income of $11.6 million, or $1.77 cents a share, on sales of $348.9 million.  The company also said it signed letters of intent to sell its Boston Whaler and Sybervision units in separate transactions and is negotiating a possible sale of its Carroll Reed subsidiary.  CML declined to say how much it will receive for its Boston Whaler and Sybervision units.  It also declined to say who is buying the companies, noting that the two buyers have asked that their identities not be made public.  But CML said the sales would be cash transactions at or above the units' respective book values.  Boston Whaler, which makes power boats, has a book value of $30 million.  The book value of Sybervision, a maker of self-improvement audio and video programs, is about $10 million.  The moves came about six weeks after Mr. Jacobs disclosed that he and Minstar Inc., a company he runs, acquired a 14.2% stake in CML and might seek to acquire the concern.  CML has indicated its opposition to a takeover.  In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CML shares closed at $23.25 each, up 37.5 cents.  A group of independent directors of Cineplex Odeon Corp. who are soliciting offers for the movie-theater chain said they have developed a short list of potential bidders.  The list includes the company's chairman, Garth Drabinsky, who has been trying to launch a bid since April.  Jack Richer, a member of the independent directors' committee, said Mr. Drabinsky and the other potential bidders, whom he wouldn't identify, "will be invited to review more detailed and confidential information about the corporation."  That information will be made available in both Toronto and Los Angeles.  Mr. Richer said he expects to begin receiving bids for Cineplex once the companies on the list have completed their review.  He said that process would take until about the end of the month.  Mr. Drabinsky has been trying to launch a bid together with Cineplex vice chairman Myron Gottlieb.  Analysts say they still expect the two executives to make a proposal, probably for 17.50 Canadian dollars (US$14.87) a share.  But they add that Mr. Drabinsky appears to be having difficulties in obtaining financing for an offer, which could cost C$780.5 million.  Together with its advisers, RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley Canada Ltd., the directors' committee is seeking alternatives to a Drabinsky bid.  "We're definitely looking to see a competitive bidding situation," Mr. Richer said.  "While we can't empty Mr. Drabinsky's head of all the knowledge of the company he's acquired, we can and are getting everyone else up to speed very quickly, to create a level playing field."  The company most frequently named as a possible bidder for Cineplex is Rank Organisation PLC, which last year acquired 49% of Cineplex's Film House Group unit and in March agreed to buy the Canadian company's 50% stake in Universal Studios Florida for $150 million.  Rank declined to comment.  Mr. Richer said the list of potential bidders includes companies outside the entertainment industry.  General Cinema Corp. of Chestnut Hill, Mass., is also rumored to be interested in acquiring Cineplex's North American operations.  A spokesman for General Cinema declined to comment.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cineplex closed at $11.875, up 50 cents.  The Senate Labor Committee unanimously approved a bill that would substantially restrict discrimination against handicapped persons by employers and concerns that serve the public.  The measure, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act, was voted out of the panel after a final round of negotiations -- particularly between committee Chairman Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and the White House -- reached a compromise over some sticky issues.  The result, though scaled down from more-ambitious versions, "is the most comprehensive civil rights legislation in 25 years," said Ralph Neas, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 180 groups lobbying for the bill.  The bill, which is supported by the White House, congressional leaders of both parties, and groups representing the disabled, is expected to pass easily.  Separately, the committee started a new round of legislative wrangling over a higher minimum wage, approving the same bill that President Bush vetoed in June.  That bill called for an increase in the wage floor to $4.55 an hour by late 1991 from the current $3.35.  Mr. Bush said he would accept only a bill boosting the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1991, coupled with a lower six-month training wage for newly hired workers.  The Democratic majority apparently wants to work for a compromise with the White House, however.  Mr. Kennedy expressed new hope that there's a "common ground" between Congress and the administration over the contentious issue.  The Senate Democrats' plan is to accept on the Senate floor an increase to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1990, with the length of any training wage undecided.  Later, the House Labor Committee would probably approve a bill boosting the wage to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1990.  But panel leaders may then go along with stretching out that rise for another year, as the White House wants, but with a training wage of two or perhaps three months, essentially for a worker's first job.  The anti-bias bill generally seeks to extend to the handicapped the same kind of protection against employer and public-access discrimination already accorded by law to minorities, older persons and women.  Current law provides narrower restrictions on discrimination against the handicapped, and is confined to companies and others who receive federal grants or contracts.  The bill will "hopefully sweep away the barriers" against the disabled, including many psychological barriers imposed by employers and others out of ignorance, Mr. Kennedy said in an interview.  He and Sen. Thomas Harkin (D., Iowa), the bill's Senate sponsor, worked with Republican Sen. David Durenberger of Minnesota, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and White House officials including Chief of Staff John Sununu, to hammer out the compromise.  A handicapped person is defined as someone with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits his or her activities.  The legislation bans discrimination against handicapped individuals in such areas as hiring and working conditions.  "Reasonable" accommodations would have to be made for the limitations of workers or applicants, unless they would mean an undue hardship for the employer.  But employers would be allowed to refuse to hire an applicant or retain employees with a contagious disease that poses a health threat to other workers, or whose use of alcohol or illegal drugs affects their work.  For the first two years after enactment, companies with fewer than 25 employees would be exempt from the employment provisions, and ones with fewer than 15 would be exempt after that.  Lawsuits by handicapped persons could only collect pay that the plaintiffs are due because of discrimination.  Under public-accommodations provisions, owners of theaters, restaurants and other public buildings would have more-stringent requirements to meet for new buildings or renovated old ones.  These have sparked protests from small-business groups, especially, that the law would be costly.  They would have to provide access and take such measures as installing wheelchair ramps.  No small-business exemptions are provided.  Private lawsuits could be filed seeking court injunctions to compel compliance with the law, and the attorney general could seek fines of up to $100,000 for a "pattern" of violations.  But jury trials or any punitive damages, included in an earlier version of the bill, wouldn't be allowed.  The measure also would require access for the handicapped to mass-transit buses, through means such as wheelchair lifts, and over-the-road buses, including toilet facilities for the handicapped, and certain access to telecommunications services.  Orders for manufactured goods, from textiles to television sets, edged up in June, but they didn't come close to recouping the previous month's steep decline, the Commerce Department reported.  Pulled up by a surge in military bookings, factory orders grew 0.4% in June after plummeting 2.6% in May.  Excluding military equipment, orders for manufactured goods actually declined 0.2%.  A number of analysts said the report pointed to continued weakness in much of the industrial sector, but they generally felt it stopped short of indicating a recession.  "It's weak but not alarmingly weak," said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.  "It seems commensurate with a soft landing scenario," he added, referring to a situation where the economy slows enough to ease inflationary pressures but not enough to topple into a recession.  But, he noted, "A soft landing does involve certain discomfort."  U.S. industry, particularly auto makers and other heavy manufacturers, has been hurt by the Federal Reserve's efforts between March 1988 and March 1989 to slow the economy and reduce inflationary pressures by driving up interest rates.  This spring the central bank relaxed its grip on credit, and some analysts expect demand for manufactured goods to pick up.  Meanwhile, most factories have been able to keep their inventories to a manageable level, reducing fears that a buildup in excess stocks will lead to the layoffs and production cutbacks that commonly precede a recession.  In June, manufacturers' inventories grew 0.3% to $366.22 billion, with most of the increase coming in aircraft and petroleum products.  Overall, new factory orders totaled $234.56 billion, compared with $233.56 billion in May and $239.91 billion in April.  Orders for durable goods -- items such as heavy machinery and household appliances, expected to last at least three years -- turned up a bit after skidding 4.4% in May.  They grew 0.4%, a little more than the 0.3% estimated in a preliminary report last week.  But orders for automotive equipment dropped a startling 7.0%.  Orders for nondurable goods also increased 0.4%, with more than half of the growth in textiles.  Meanwhile, factories can be assured of continued work.  The backlog of unfilled orders continued to rise in June, climbing 0.5% to $490.34 billion.  In a separate report, the Commerce Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development said sales of newly built single-family homes, spurred by falling mortgage rates, jumped 5.5% in June to an annual rate of 670,000.  That follows gains of 4.3% in May and 9.7% in April, after sales in March hit their slowest pace since the end of the last recession.  However the figures in this report are notoriously imprecise, and the report's authors admit to a margin of error so great that they are uncertain whether there was actually an increase or a decrease.  According to the report, the median price of new houses grew to $129,900 in June from $120,000 in May, meaning that half the homes sold were above those prices and half were below.  The average price rose to $159,100 from $146,800 in May.  The numbers in both reports were adjusted for seasonal variations.  Here are the Commerce Department's latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.  @ June May  @ 1989 1989 %Chg.  @ All industries 234.56 233.56 + 0.4  @ Durable goods 124.19 123.68 + 0.4  @ Nondurable goods 110.36 109.89 + 0.4  @ Capital goods industries 46.35 44.86 + 3.3  @ Nondefense 37.39 37.29 + 0.3  @ Defense 8.96 7.57 +18.3  @ Total shipments 231.94 233.07 - 0.5  @ Inventories 366.22 365.06 + 0.3  @ Backlog of orders 490.34 487.72 + 0.5  Dealing with the press is an increasingly important part of the legal business, particularly for firms involved in highly visible corporate takeover battles.  But one firm with much experience in the takeover game, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, is finding that providing apparently routine help to a reporter can be fraught with peril.  The Delaware Supreme Court has begun proceedings that could result in a contempt-of-court citation against Barbara Robbins, a Wachtell Lipton partner, because Ms. Robbins provided a copy of a confidential document about the battle for Time Inc. to a reporter for the New York Times.  Ms. Robbins told the court she thought the document wasn't covered by a court order of confidentiality, but the court is treating her mistake quite seriously nonetheless.  Ms. Robbins, who was representing Warner Communications Inc., which Time is now acquiring in a friendly merger, admitted in a letter to the court that she had provided the document, which contained investment bankers' estimates of the prices that Time's magazines could command in a sale.  However, Ms. Robbins explained in the letter that she thought the document could be made public because it hadn't been stamped "confidential" or "filed under seal."  Still the Delaware Supreme Court has ordered Ms. Robbins to appear Aug. 22 to show why she shouldn't be held in contempt for violating a court order that certain documents in the case remain under seal.  The court could issue a citation and fine Ms. Robbins, or it could decide not to cite her.  Ms. Robbins was on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment.  Michael Schwartz, a partner at Wachtell Lipton, said, "This was an unfortunate outcome from the failure to follow the uniform practice of stamping documents confidential.  It was inadvertent."  A spokesman for Time said, "It was unfortunate that that material was published, but we're certain that it was released inadvertently."  A spokesman for New York Times Co. declined to comment.  The dispute stems from litigation initiated by Paramount Communications Inc. and some disgruntled Time shareholders who wanted the Delaware courts to block Time's $14 billion purchase of Warner, arguing that it was an unlawful defensive tactic intended to frustrate Paramount's hostile tender offer for Time.  The documents in question were prepared by Time's investment bankers, but were contained in court papers filed by Paramount and the angry Time shareholders.  The documents, among other things, estimated that People magazine could be sold for $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion and that Time and Life magazines together could be sold for about $1 billion.  Time, however, has said that it doesn't plan to sell any of its magazines.  After the Delaware Supreme Court ruled on July 24 that Time could proceed with its acquisition of Warner, Ms. Robbins sent copies of various documents filed by Warner and Paramount to the New York Times at the newspaper's request.  Ms. Robbins said she declined to provide documents filed by Time, because she knew they were confidential.  She said she didn't realize the Paramount documents contained confidential information.  In her letter to the state supreme court, Ms. Robbins said, "As Warner's counsel, I certainly would have had no desire to release to the public documents as to which Time sought confidential treatment."  Although it appears that the Time-Warner side only damaged itself by releasing the documents, legal experts say that argument may not impress the Delaware court.  "Once the court issues an order (such as the one sealing the Time documents), it has an independent interest in the integrity of its process," said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University Law School and an expert on legal ethics.  The court "wants to make it clear that it is not simply a passive player on this issue," Mr. Gillers said.  Four major companies announced various commitments to help reduce or eliminate their use of chlorofluorocarbons, widely used as refrigerants and as a cleaning agent in manufacturing.  CFCs are man-made compounds linked to a hazardous depletion of the Earth's ozone layer.  General Motors Corp. said it will require its dealers to install CFC recycling systems by the fall of 1990 for the 1991-model year.  The equipment will be available to dealers for the 1990-model year.  Japan's Nissan Motor Co. also said that by 1993 its car air conditioners and manufacturing processes will be completely free of CFCs.  Meanwhile, General Electric Co., which is releasing CFCs into the atmosphere as the result of a major refrigerator compressor replacement program, pledged to find ways to offset that amount by other unspecified reductions, a step criticized as inadequate by environmental groups.  On Tuesday, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. announced that it plans to eliminate chlorofluorocarbons from all of its manufacturing processes by 1994.  AT&T's new CFC-elimination policy also calls for the company to pare its 1986 CFC usage level 50% by 1991.  An international treaty, the Montreal Protocol, requires that by 1998, production as well as consumption of CFCs be cut to half of 1986 levels.  GM said that beginning this fall, the Kent-Moore Group of SPX Corp. will supply GM dealers, as well as fleet garages and GM factories, with CFC recycling systems manufactured by Muskegon, Mich.-based SPX's Robinair unit.  The equipment, expected to sell for about $2,500, assuming that it gets final Underwriters Laboratories approval, drains CFCs from a car's air conditioner, purifies it, and returns it to the car, GM said.  Previously, dealers had vented old CFCs into the atmosphere.  U.S. auto makers also are rushing to develop new air conditioning systems that don't use CFCs.  GM says it expects to begin offering non-CFC air conditioners in 1994 models that will go on sale in the fall of 1993.  A Nissan spokesman said the company, with the aid of air conditioner makers Hitachi Ltd. and Calsonic Corp., is developing car air conditioners that use a new substance to replace CFCs.  The company already has stopped using one form of CFC in making auto bumpers.  GE's commitment was announced in Washington by Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn), who began holding discussions with the company after environmental groups called to his attention GE's plan to replace nearly one million compressors in a $450 million refrigerator repair program.  The program meant GE repairmen would be venting into the atmosphere an estimated eight to 10 ounces of CFCs for each repair.  GE has committed to find ways to reduce its CFC usage by an amount equal to the CFCs lost during the repair program.  A GE spokesman in Louisville, Ky., said the commitment would involve about 300,000 pounds of CFCs.  Although GM's announcement indicated it envisions a machine to recapture and recycle CFCs, the GE spokesman said appropriate systems aren't available to do the same with refrigerator repairs.  The spokesman said the company couldn't specify how it plans to achieve the reduction in CFC usage.  "Freon isn't reusable when you take it out," the spokesman said.  "It gets contaminated and has to be purified and filtered.  A system doesn't exist that will capture, transport, clean, repackage and retransport" the CFCs, which are considered hazardous chemicals, he said.  "We're not saying it can't be done.  We're saying it isn't available today."  William Walsh, a spokesman for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington, said GE's announcement "lags far behind the public commitments" of other industries that support mandatory recycling of CFCs.  He said GE should require all authorized service agents to have refrigerant recovery systems by Jan. 1, and postpone the compressor replacement program if necessary.  CFC recycling devices for refrigerators would be smaller and easier to handle than those for automobiles, he asserted.  The $250,000 houseboat proved the giveaway.  Top executives of Atek Metals Center Inc. had grown suspicious of their controller's opulent life style.  And Jeanetta Ponchot's new houseboat, purchased with cash, spurred officials to pore over the books of the Cincinnati maker of specialty metals products.  In late May, they discovered at least $700,000 had vanished.  Immediately, they asked for and received a court freeze on Ms. Ponchot's assets.  By acting as soon as it discovered the money was missing, Atek Metals may have lessened what could have been even more devastating losses.  Nevertheless, the amount equaled the company's first-half profits for its fiscal 1989.  Unlike Atek Metals, most small companies aren't as perceptive or as quick to act, say fraud investigators and consultants.  Few are equipped to detect embezzlement, often because they can't afford extensive internal safeguards.  Indeed, "half of those caught are nabbed by accident," says Joseph T. Wells, chairman of the National Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a trade group based in Austin, Texas.  Tips snare one-third and audits the rest, Mr. Wells said.  Even if a theft is uncovered, many companies don't know how to recover the funds.  "Once a company thinks the money can't be recovered, it asks if it's worth the bother, and the answer is usually 'no,' says Mr. Wells, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation fraud sleuth.  "They don't want the negative publicity."  And by sweeping the wrongdoing under the rug, executives seek to avoid being accused of mismanagement by directors and shareholders.  Yet by doing so, embezzlers are free to commit the same crime elsewhere, exacerbating the problem.  Employee theft costs businesses an estimated $70 billion to $100 billion a year.  Atek Metals, rather than hiding the matter, pressed charges in Butler County Court in Ohio.  In a civil suit filed last month, the company accused Jeanetta Ponchot of stealing the money over the past two years by substituting her name for that of Atek Metals on checks from suppliers, as well as pocketing travel expenses charged by employees to the company.  When confronted by superiors, she handed over the title to the boat and $75,000 in cash, according to the company's suit.  Ms. Ponchot declined comment.  An investigation by the company continues.  Besides recovering the houseboat and $75,000, Atek Metals officials, who are reluctant to disclose details of the case, also filed the suit to recover the rest of the funds and to ask for punitive damages.  Atek Metal's case, like many others of its kind, involved an employee who was considered something of a model.  She has been described by Barry F. Bucher, Atek Metal's chief executive officer as "very loyal, devoted employee, who earned a lot of trust from us."  Ms. Ponchot joined the firm as an accountant and became a controller within five years, the company says.  Acting on a tip, however, Atek Metal officials say they became suspicious about their controller's life style, which strengthened their belief she was living well beyond her $45,000-a-year salary.  Without the tip -- the source of which the company refused to characterize in any way -- Atek Metals perhaps wouldn't have conducted an audit and uncovered the accounting discrepancies.  All of which suggests how difficult it can be to catch a thief inside the company -- especially when the company is small.  Smaller companies, in particular, make themselves vulnerable to embezzlement because they often permit a single official or just a couple of employees to handle their finances.  That can foster fraud.  A former accountant and chief financial officer of First National Bank in Crossville, Tenn., pleaded guilty to stealing $112,000.  He could transfer funds to his account undetected and then write them off as bank expenses.  In another case, an accountant at a Lincoln, Neb., light-fixture company pleaded guilty to embezzling $416,000 by cooking the accounting ledgers.  Because she worked alone, she would write a check to a supplier for, say, $15,000, then write down $20,000 on the books, taking the $5,000 for herself.  "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out you shouldn't have a person write the checks and balance the books," says Mr. Wells.  "But that's fairly common."  Fraud investigators contend companies could prevent embezzling -- or at least catch it in its early stages -- by employing an internal auditor who could raise a red flag to suspicious accounting.  "Having an outsider who comes in once in a while won't do it," says Albert Murphy, a veteran security consultant.  Outside auditors, he notes, usually include a disclaimer in their contracts that seeks to protect them should they fail to uncover fraud.  For small companies that can't afford internal auditors or two people to divide bookkeeping and accounting duties, financial consultants recommend more periodic audits by an outside firm, or simply having a company's bank statements delivered unopened to a top executive for review.  The larger lessons here are numerous.  A company's top executives also should be wary even if an employee with access to the purse strings has been an exemplary performer.  Executives might also do well to consider why employees embezzle.  Increasingly, white-collar criminals steal to support an expensive drug habit, security experts say.  Others embezzle because "they feel they're entitled to it," says Mr. Murphy.  Either way, the embezzler often will exhibit some physical or emotional sign, which should raise a red flag.  Many embezzlers get away with fraud because their employers don't know what to do once they uncover it or how to recover the stolen funds.  Security experts suggest several actions that small companies in particular can employ to recover much or all of the stolen funds.  Companies can follow Atek Metal's example and seek restitution directly from the accused employee or by filing a civil suit seeking repayment directly or through assets.  "Generally, in the best interest of the company and investors, I recommend going this way," Mr. Murphy says.  Companies can also take out an insurance policy -- known as a fidelity bond -- on its top officers.  In order to collect, the company must prove through accounting records or receipts that fraud occurred.  A conviction or admission of wrongdoing will also suffice to claim a loss.  If funds can't be recovered, take a federal tax deduction for theft losses to ease the impact on the company's earnings, recommends G.J. Bologna, former head of a fraud-auditing firm and now associate professor of management at Siena Heights College in Michigan.  He also favors informing the Internal Revenue Service of the fraud to prevent the employee from embezzling again.  "If it's been going on for more than a year, the embezzler must have falsified his taxes," Mr. Bologna says.  "Notifying the IRS is totally devastating to them."  @ ---  @ Embezzlement Losses  @ (Including bank embezzlements)  @ ARRESTS MADE  @ FBI BY FBI FOR  @ CITATIONS EMBEZZLEMENT  @ 1988 $2,191,756,491 N.A.  @ 1987 860,599,398 12,700  @ 1986 606,154,566 12,600  @ 1980 N.A. 8,500  @ N.A. = Not available  Joan Kaner, 55 years old, was named senior vice president and fashion director of the Neiman Marcus division of this retailing company.  The position has been vacant for several years.  Ms. Kaner was formerly vice president and fashion director of womens wear at R. H. Macy & Co. in New York.  Former Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian was set back in his effort to limit how many financial documents he must turn over to Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers.  U.S. Magistrate Patrick J. Attridge of the federal court in Washington ruled that the SEC was entitled to seek records of Mr. Bilzerian's tax returns, property purchases, credit-card transactions, travel outside the U.S. and telephone calls in connection with its civil lawsuit against the corporate raider.  Mr. Bilzerian was sued by the SEC last month in connection with a series of takeover bids.  Alleging numerous violations of securities laws, the SEC sought $31.3 million in allegedly illegal profits from several of Mr. Bilzerian's stock transactions from 1985 through 1988.  In court papers filed last month, the SEC said it wanted to ascertain the value and location of Mr. Bilzerian's assets as quickly as possible because it feared some assets had been hidden abroad.  And it sought extensive documentation from Mr. Bilzerian, who has denied that he has any assets abroad.  Mr. Bilzerian opposed the SEC's request for his financial records on the ground that it was an invasion of his privacy.  He said the scope of the SEC request made it unduly burdensome and contended the SEC was unlikely to obtain a judgment against him when its case went to trial.  Mr. Bilzerian offered, however, to disclose to the SEC under oath information about his assets and to submit copies of his most recent tax returns.  Magistrate Attridge called Mr. Bilzerian's assertion that the SEC was unlikely to obtain a civil judgement against him "astounding" in light of his criminal conviction on related activities.  Mr. Bilzerian was convicted by a New York jury on nine felony counts related to securities-law violations on June 9.  The magistrate also termed Mr. Bilzerian's compromise offer unacceptable and said he could not be relied upon to tell the truth, even under oath.  The court found, however, that the SEC had provided no restrictions on the dates for which it sought documents, and he limited the request to transactions occurring on or after Jan. 1, 1985.  In addition, the court ruled that there was no evidence to date that Mr. Bilzerian's wife or children had been implicated in any of his activities.  The court found that to protect their privacy, any records of phone calls or credit card transactions in their names would not have to be turned over to the SEC.  Mr. Bilzerian's attorney said he hadn't decided whether to appeal.  Pacific Enterprises said its Pacific Enterprises Oil Co. unit discovered a natural-gas field in Monroe County, Miss.  The Patterson 26-12 No. 1 discovery well in the new East Aberdeen field, three miles east of the producing Aberdeen field, tested in excess of 2.5 million cubic feet of gas a day from two formations, Carter A and B, the utility-holding company said.  Carter A tested at 1.4 million cubic feet of gas daily on a 9/32-inch choke at a flowing tubing pressure of 700 pounds per square inch in the interval between 3,076 feet and 3,136 feet.  Carter B tested at 1.1 million cubic feet daily on a 7/32-inch choke with a flowing pressure of 900 pounds per square inch in the interval from 3,186 to 3,190 feet.  Home Shopping Network Inc.'s lawsuit against GTE Corp. backfired when a jury ordered the video retailer and two of its officers to pay GTE $100 million for defamation.  Home Shopping, of St. Petersburg, Fla., had been seeking $1.5 billion in punitive and compensatory damages from the Stamford, Conn., telephone company for alleged phone foul-ups that Home Shopping claimed cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.  But the jury instead granted a GTE counterclaim after a six-week trial in state court in Tampa, Fla.  Home Shopping's shares plummeted on the news.  In American Stock Exchange composite trading, the stock yesterday fell $1 to close at $3.375.  The judgment includes a $20 million award against the company and $40 million awards against Roy M. Speer, chairman and chief executive officer, and Lowell Paxson, president.  Home Shopping said it would appeal, saying the court erred in allowing the jury to consider the counterclaim.  A spokeswoman said Home Shopping has liability insurance, but she didn't know how much.  "If the judgment has to be paid, it's a pretty devastating blow to {Home Shopping} because it comes at a time when it is having some operational difficulties," said J. Timothy Rice, a partner at Johnson Rice & Co. in New Orleans.  GTE and two GTE units argued that Home Shopping had falsely blamed faulty telephone service for its plummeting fortunes when the actual cause was mismanagement, poor planning and unbridled growth at the discount video retailer.  "The jury has completely vindicated us," Edward C. Schmults, GTE senior vice president, external affairs, and general counsel, said in a statement.  "The GTE companies provided excellent service to Home Shopping Network throughout the relationship and were, in fact, major contributors to HSN's phenomenal growth."  Home Shopping argued that GTE knew its phone system was grossly inadequate, but concealed it from Home Shopping, which was relying on the phones as a lifeline for customer sales.  A key piece of evidence was an internal GTE memo that said Home Shopping's phone system was overloaded and as many as 26,000 callers an hour were getting busy signals.  In its defense, GTE said it couldn't have anticipated Home Shopping's explosive growth.  The phone company called the suit a "sham" and an attempt to reverse a steady decline in Home Shopping's stock price.  GTE said a series of setbacks at Home Shopping prompted its stock to tumble from a high of $40.125 in January 1987 to $19 three months later.  It also asserted Home Shopping sold shoddy merchandise and then suffered from a high percentage of returns, including some 69.2% of fur coats and 47.3% of personal computers.  Part of GTE's claim rested on an April 1987 Home Shopping news release blaming GTE for the alleged loss of 50% of customer calls the month before.  GTE argued that Home Shopping's Messrs.  Speers and Paxson had a strong motive to try to prop up the stock price: they owned a total of 64 million shares of Home Shopping at the time.  Home Shopping denied it or its officers falsely blamed GTE. Mr. Speers and Mr. Paxson couldn't be reached for comment.  As a result of the verdict Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service placed the Ba-3 rating of Home Shopping's senior notes and the B-2 rating of the company's convertible subordinated Eurobonds under review for possible downgrade.  Investor Irwin Jacobs renewed his pursuit of Avon Products Inc. with a go-it-alone, $2.85 billion bid for the cosmetics giant.  Avon said its board would consider the all-cash $41-a-share offer for common stock at a regularly scheduled meeting today, but a company spokesman noted that "the board has repeatedly said that Avon isn't for sale."  Wall Street took a skeptical view.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Avon stock rose $1 yesterday, closing at $36.50 on volume of 2.3 million shares.  "Once burned, twice shy," said an arbitrager, referring to an aborted offer that Amway Corp. made for Avon with Mr. Jacobs's participation.  The Minneapolis investor was frustrated when Amway abruptly abandoned that $39-a-share offer in May after encountering an unusually hostile response from Avon's management.  Avon hired private detectives to investigate the bidders, accused them of securities-law violations and referred to Mr. Jacobs as "a well-known corporate raider who has not completed an acquisition for many years."  Amway still holds nearly half of a 10.1% stake in Avon through a partnership with Mr. Jacobs but isn't part of the latest bid, the investor said.  While prepared for more hostilities -- his letter to Avon's board said he expected a "knee-jerk" rejection from the company -- Mr. Jacobs nonetheless indicated he is hoping for a friendly takeover.  "Why not sit down with me to explore the feasibility of this transaction?" his letter asked.  "Why not demonstrate to me why I should pay more if you find $41 to be inadequate."  In his letter, Mr. Jacobs said that, like Amway, he would sell Avon's Giorgio Beverly Hills Inc. and Parfumes Stern Inc. units, as well as other operations that Avon may be treating as discontinued.  In recent months the New York-based company has been disposing of ancillary businesses to concentrate on its lines of household goods and cosmetics, which are distributed primarily through a direct-sales force.  Avon has been considered a takeover target because of what many investors view as underperforming assets.  Indeed, one argument management has used for remaining independent is to show that its new strategy will work.  Yesterday several analysts and professional investors expressed doubts about Mr. Jacobs's ability to deliver on his bid.  "Mr.  Jacobs intended to take the money and run when he was doing this deal with Amway," said Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Andrew Shore.  "Now he wants to own Avon just a few months later?  Unless he gets the financing in place and makes a firm tender, nobody believes him."  Perhaps anticipating that view, Mr. Jacobs disclosed how he plans to line up most of the $4.1 billion in financing for the proposed acquisition.  The purchase of 54.9 million common shares, including the stake held by Mr. Jacobs's partnership with Amway, would cost $2.25 billion.  The 18 million shares of $2 preferred-equity redemption cumulative stock would cost an additional $603 million at the current repurchase price of $33.50.  Moreover, Mr. Jacbobs said he plans to refinance Avon's $1 billion in debt and intends to put $500 million in equity into his takeover vehicle.  Citicorp, in a "Dear Irwin" letter which Mr. Jacobs filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, said it would consider committing $1 billion in financing itself and "endeavor to arrange" for $2.6 billion from other lenders.  Mr. Jacobs didn't indicate the source of the equity financing.  Although he has employed junk bonds in numerous previous deals, Mr. Jacobs said there would be no junk financing in the Avon bid.  "This will be straight bank financing, and will be done with enough equity in it that it doesn't slow down opportunities for growth in the company," he said.  One arbitrager who bought Avon stock when Amway put the company into play said he would be more cautious this time, alluding to the big losses that Amway's sudden withdrawal brought on many speculators.  "If the board says they are adamant about remaining independent, Mr. Jacobs will have to become involved in a hostile offer," he said.  Mr. Jacobs didn't preclude that possibility, but said in his letter that "I very much prefer to proceed with a transaction on a friendly basis."  As for a repetition of Avon's batten-down-the-hatches defense, he said in an interview, "I don't want to talk about nastiness right now.  I want to talk about friendly things."  His letter to Avon argued that despite the company's "violent rejection" of the Amway offer, "I believe that a majority of the company's shareholders would welcome the opportunity to vote upon an . . . all-cash price" for their stock.  "Perhaps many shareholders do not share your optimism as reflected in your projections, and would prefer to take a premium price to market and invest elsewhere," he wrote.  Sources said that Avon hasn't had any contact with Mr. Jacobs since Amway abandoned its bid.  But shortly after he faxed his offering letter to the company Tuesday evening, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer, James E. Preston, called to tell Mr. Jacobs he had received it.  The investor described it as a "cordial" conversation.  In late May, Avon also rebuffed an expression of interest by Dallas-based Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc.  In his latest bid, Mr. Jacobs sought to distance himself from Mary Kay and Amway.  "Let me assure you," he wrote to Avon, "that neither Amway Corp. nor Mary Kay Cosmetics is in any way participating in my bid, and I have no intention of forming any understandings with Amway or Mary Kay as to any involvement with the company" in the future.  Mr. Jacobs said yesterday he hadn't contacted Mary Kay about participating in his own bid.  Mary Kay officials couldn't be reached for comment.  ---  @ A Look at Some of Irwin Jacobs's Takeover Efforts  @ 1975 -- Launches career with $4 million purchase of small Minneapolis brewery  @ 1980 -- Abandons acquisition of American Distilling Co.  @ 1981 -- Loses bidding war for Pabst Brewing Co.  @ 1984 -- Sells 7.7% stake in Walt Disney Productions to Bass Family, ending takeover threat  @ 1985 -- Acquires AMF Inc. for $563.8 million  @ 1986 -- Outbid by Boone Pickens Jr. for Pioneer Corp.  @ 1987 -- Backs off on proxy fight for Gillette Co.; thwarted by management in $3.29 billion Borg-Warner Corp. bid  @ 1988 -- Takes Minstar Inc. holding company private  @ March 1989 -- Outbid for Shaklee Corp. by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., but grosses $44 million profit  @ May 1989 -- Drops $11-a-share bid for Tidewater Inc.; rebuffed in Amway Corp. -- led bid for Avon Products Inc.  @ July 1989 -- As major stakeholder, profits nicely on CVN Cos. sale to QVC Network  @ Aug. 2, 1989 -- Bids $1.98 billion for Avon shares he doesn't already hold  These aren't the days of wine and roses for U.S. vintners.  The domestic wine industry is facing one of its worst years in memory.  Consumers are forsaking wine coolers and resisting price increases on certain "fighting varietals": California's more affordable versions of traditional fine wines, all the rage since the mid-'80s.  Above all, quaffers are snubbing jug wines, which account for about 70% of table wine sales in the U.S.  So, a number of vintners, large and small, are showing signs of battle fatigue.  No. 2-ranked Heublein Inc., a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, is registering steep declines in its Almaden and Inglenook lines.  Earlier this month, Vintners International Co. began showing signs of financial weakness and cut the marketing budget for its Paul Masson and Taylor Wines.  But the $1 billion wine empire built by Ernest and Julio, the obsessively secretive Gallo brothers, is hanging tough.  In this year's first five months, total shipments by E. & J. Gallo Winery, the country's largest, rose 1% from a year earlier even as shipments by the industry as a whole fell 8%, according to Gomberg, Frederickson & Associates, which tracks the wine industry in San Francisco.  In many ways, Gallo's resilience is surprising.  The catch phrase among wine makers is that consumers are "drinking less but better" -- which would hardly seem to favor Gallo's screw-top image.  But despite big drops in its own jug business, the company is gaining market share, though not volume, in part by wearing down other rivals through sheer size, marketing muscle and financial resources.  More important for its future, Gallo is finally having some success in the more prestigious -- and profitable -- varietal wines, which for years seemed impervious to the company's marketing magic.  The industry calls these better-quality, higher-priced wines varietals because they are identified by the main variety of grape -- such as Cabernet, Chardonnay or Zinfandel -- used in the wine.  "Ten years from now, Gallo will be a Harvard case study of what you do to convert a giant company from one category to another," says Paul Gillette, editor of the Wine Investor, an industry newsletter.  Robert Trinchero, chief executive of Sutter Home Winery, a varietal producer in St. Helena, Calif., adds: "To write Gallo off as a jug-wine producer is very dangerous."  Statistics that Gallo says it hasn't previously disclosed are telling.  In 1973, no Gallo table wines had corks, and in 1980 only 10% did.  Today, the figure is 37%.  Skeptics are quick to note that this dramatic rise has much to do with Gallo's current penchant for putting its generic wines, such as Hearty Burgundy and Blush Chablis, into fancier bottles.  But Gallo insists that the jump also reflects its status as a major producer of varietal wines.  According to Impact, a trade publication, Gallo's sales of varietals will increase about 46% this year to 3.5 million cases from 2.4 million cases in 1988.  Despite such strides, some rivals and former executives warn that the vintner has grown increasingly risk-averse.  "The biggest thing that's different nowadays is that Gallo has become more of a follower than an innovator," says a former Gallo brand manager who asked not to be identified.  "Gallo has a good pulse on the market, but they are very slow to react."  The company's hesitancy has forced it to share leadership in the cooler category with Seagram Co. and has left it playing catch-up in varietal wines.  Last October, Gallo's introduction of Tott's champagne, a pricier alternative to the much-derided Andre brand, also backfired badly.  The winery apparently couldn't decide which of its rivals -- Cook's or Korbel -- it wanted to copy, and Tott's ended up being a poor imitation of both brands.  Pushing Gallo upscale long has been the dream of 80-year-old Ernest, the marketing whiz, and 79-year-old Julio, the master wine maker.  The initiative -- which will take Gallo far from its early success in the '50s as maker of down-and-dirty wino potables such as Thunderbird -- has gained new urgency at the behest of the elder Gallos' three sons and a son-in-law, who run the company day to day.  Though a Gallo spokesman agreed to a brief interview, none of the Gallos would be interviewed for this article.  In any case, as Gallo takes its new White Zinfandel wine national this month, the company's strategy seems clear.  Although the product is long overdue -- the winery began contemplating a Zinfandel entry a full four years ago -- timing may be on Gallo's side.  Soaring grape prices have led many other wine makers to raise prices or discontinue their offerings this year. (Gallo is buffered by long-term contracts with growers.)  Moreover, Gallo's White Grenache varietal wine, introduced last fall, already has made its mark.  Frank Walters, director of research at Impact, estimates that White Grenache will sell about 1.3 million cases this year, making it the second biggest "blush" varietal brand (so called because, though made from red grapes, it has only a faint color).  In part, the success of White Grenache owes to the vaunted ability of the winery's salesmen and distributors to muscle product onto retail shelves.  In addition, a controversial advertising campaign for Gallo's Grenache, vowing to "change the way you think about Gallo," seems to be persuading the winery's legion of quaffers in Middle America to trade up to its more expensive wines.  Gallo's varietals typically cost $3.50 to $4.50 for a 750-milliliter bottle -- the standard size for fine wines.  By contrast, a 1.5-liter bottle of Gallo's jug wines usually sells for $4.99.  "With the masses, the changeover is complete," says David Terk, an independent distributor in Abilene, Texas.  But for all Ernest and Julio's grand ambitions, their quest for quality at the premium end is still elusive.  Although the Gallos are renowned for the taste of their low-end wines like Hearty Burgundy, "they haven't been consistent with their Chardonnays or their Cabernets, the two wines that people tend to use to judge a winery," says Michael Benziger, who runs Glen Ellen Winery, Glen Ellen, Calif.  Even more intractable, the Gallo name doesn't exactly wow the crystal-goblet set.  The tony Four Seasons restaurant in New York recently began to offer a $12.50 bottle of Gallo's Cabernet Sauvignon.  Julian Niccolini, the restaurant's manager, calls the wine "excellent" but says the restaurant sells only one bottle a week: "When people come to the Four Seasons, they don't dare to order a wine with such a name."  Many industry executives say that to be recognized as a fine wine maker, Gallo will have to sell its vintages under another label.  Despite a persistent rumor that Gallo was negotiating to acquire Glen Ellen (denied by both companies), former executives say the esteem in which the elder Gallos hold their name makes such a scenario unlikely -- at least in their lifetimes.  In the meantime, some rivals and ad executives say the advertising promise to "change the way you think about Gallo" will only intensify the brand's stigma among sophisticated wine drinkers.  Hal Riney & Partners, the ad agency that Gallo fired in late 1987, avoided apologizing, directly or indirectly, for what the vintner represented.  "The business of raising your eyebrows and saying, 'Golly gee whillikers, it's Gallo,' is dangerous because it just tends to reinforce questions and nervousness," says one ad executive familiar with Gallo.  But Gallo insists that such naysaying is sour grapes.  A company spokesman dismisses doubts about the quality of its upper-end wines as "laughable."  He calls the Grenache commercial "the most effective advertising we have ever had."  As for the putative lack of cachet in the Gallo name, the spokesman counters: "The only mystique we understand is sales."  ---  @ Where Gallo Stands Now  @ The top wine marketers  @ U.S. market shares based on total 1988 wine shipments of 189 million cases.

A federal jury decided that six defendants, recently convicted of racketeering in a case involving unlawful trading by Princeton/Newport Limited Partnership, must forfeit assets totaling $3.8 million, far less than the government had sought.  But Judge Robert Carter immediately indicated that he was inclined to overrule the jury and award the government the full amount it requested, $21.7 million.  The forfeiture verdict, issued after little more than a day of deliberations, completed the second phase of the case against five officials of Princeton/Newport and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader.  The six defendants were convicted Monday on all but one of 64 felony counts involving a variety of acts of conspiracy, racketeering and securities, wire and mail fraud.  Two of those counts related to charges stemming from the potent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO. RICO requires convicted defendants to forfeit their profits from the alleged wrongdoing, plus interest, as well as their salaries during the period of wrongdoing and their stake in what the law calls a "racketeering enterprise."  Defense lawyers hailed the jury's rejection of the government's full forfeiture claim.  "The jury was assuaging their own conscience" by granting the government only a small part of what it sought in forfeitures, said Jack Arsenault, an attorney for one of the defendants.  "They questioned what they did on Monday," he added.  But prosecutors were quick to object to yesterday's jury verdict, arguing that the jury had acted beyond its authority.  They said it was the jury's duty to determine only whether the defendants owned interests in the racketeering enterprise, which in this case was Princeton/Newport.  If such an interest was found, argued Mark Hansen, an assistant U.S. attorney, the law automatically permits the government to require forfeiture of that entire interest.  Judge Carter agreed.  "My view is that the interest in the enterprise is totally forfeitable," he said after the forfeiture verdict was issued.  "If the government makes a motion, I'll rule that they are totally forfeitable."  Jurors determined that James Sutton Regan, the managing general partner of Princeton/Newport, must forfeit $3 million of the $15.1 million that prosecutors sought.  Jack Z. Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman, all of whom were general partners of the investment firm, must forfeit $200,000 each.  Jurors determined that Steven B. Smotrich, a defendant who was Princeton/Newport's comptroller, must forfeit $1,245.85, or 1% of the $124,585 that the government sought from him.  "We thought he {Mr.  Smotrich} was 1% guilty," said Michelle Rodriguez, a juror in the case.  Ms. Rodriguez added that she and other jurors believed that what the government sought in forfeitures "was exorbitant."  The jury determined that Bruce Lee Newberg, a former Drexel junk-bond trader, must forfeit $200,000.  The government had sought $2.6 million from him.  Judith Larabee, another juror in the case, said after the forfeiture verdict was issued yesterday that the jury had "very carefully" considered all of the evidence presented to it.  "I feel we were a very conscientious jury," she said.  Asked why the jury convicted the defendants on virtually all of the counts, Mrs. Larabee said, "If you sat through the trial, you obviously know that the tapes were a dominant part of the evidence."  Indeed, dozens of tape recorded phone conversations comprised the bulk of the government's case.  Those tapes featured the defendants talking to officials of other securities firms about securities trades that the government alleges were illegal.  In these conversations, the government charged, Princeton/Newport officials arranged to sell securities at a loss and then repurchase them later at the same or higher prices; such a practice is known as stock parking.  In this case, the government said, the aim was to claim unlawful tax losses.  U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the government is pleased by the convictions because "we hope it sends the appropriate signal to the {securities} industry -- that we and the Department of Justice are committed to enforcement."  Mr. Romano said that prosecutors in his office are encouraged by the Princeton/Newport verdict and think it will bear on the government's case against Michael Milken, Drexel's former chief of junk bond operations, who was indicted in March.  The Princeton/Newport verdict "has to encourage us somewhat because there's some overlap between the transactions involved in the two cases," he said.  Defense attorneys in the Princeton/Newport case said they will appeal the verdict.  Robert S. Parker, 44-year-old vice president, sales, at this maker of writing instruments and school and office supplies, was named executive vice president, a newly created post.  Here's a tidbit many mutual fund investors don't know about: Some "personality" funds aren't piloted by the big shots whose names are on the door.  Kurt Lindner doesn't manage the Lindner funds.  John Templeton doesn't actively run the Templeton funds.  James Benham doesn't manage the sizzling Benham zero-coupon bond funds.  Mario Gabelli doesn't guide the Gabelli Growth Fund.  George Putnam doesn't even run the George Putnam Fund of Boston.  When many investors see a hot-shot portfolio manager's name on a fund, they "automatically assume that individual is running it, and people tend to be attracted to that," says Jonathan Pond, president of Financial Planning Information Inc., a Watertown, Mass., research firm.  Of course, a portfolio manager is less significant in some funds than in others.  Managers of some rigidly run bond portfolios, such as many Benham funds, invest in a narrow sector of the market; these funds aren't as actively managed as some stock portfolios.  And fund groups insist the founder's philosophy still guides the investment strategy of many of these personality funds.  Still, a portfolio manager is probably the single most important factor in choosing a mutual fund.  Even though funds aren't required to disclose changes in fund managers, some analysts contend that personality funds that aren't managed by their namesakes can be misleading.  "It's a key piece of information, and you can make a case that to some degree it's false advertising," says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank of New York.  What counts most, however, is the bottom line.  And many personality funds without the personality have solid track records -- in a few cases better than the funds actually run by the star manager.  For example, the $52 million Gabelli Growth Fund, run by Elizabeth Bramwell, recently has outpaced the $292 million Gabelli Asset Fund, run by Mario Gabelli.  Gabelli Growth has surged 31.9% this year through July 27, and 38.8% over the past 12 months; Gabelli Asset has risen 25.3% and 32.8%, respectively, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.  Despite the two funds' success, the investment styles of Ms. Bramwell and Mr. Gabelli are vastly different.  Mr. Gabelli stresses so-called value investing, which involves buying stocks based primarily on their private-market value, or what someone would be willing to pay for the company.  Ms. Bramwell's philosophy focuses more on earnings momentum, stocks that show consistently strong earnings growth.  There isn't much overlap in the stocks picked in the two funds.  Gabelli group officials stress that there is no confusion among investors.  The growth fund's ads even feature Ms. Bramwell's picture, they say.  The fund boasts the Gabelli name because it "helped in promotion, and that association is helping the fund to grow," says Annemarie Gilly, a Gabelli vice president.  "With its solid performance, it probably should be called the Bramwell Fund," Ms. Gilly says.  "Maybe it will be some day."  But other funds aren't so upfront, and that roils some industry analysts.  For instance, the Mutual Fund Monitor, a Berkeley, Calif., newsletter, recently cut the Lindner Fund from its recommended list.  One reason, says editor Larry Luce, is that investors aren't told much about the fund's activities in periodic shareholder reports.  "They are always signed by Kurt Lindner alone," Mr. Luce writes.  He adds that shareholders "have never received any suggestion that anyone but Kurt Lindner is in charge."  Lindner fund officials dismiss the criticism.  "Some of the original investors probably perceive him as still running the fund," says Eric Ryback, co-manager of the Linder Fund.  "But I don't think that's true with the holders of the last couple of years."  Mr. Lindner hasn't actively managed the funds for several years.  Mr. Ryback stresses that both funds follow Mr. Lindner's strict value approach to investing.  And their performance has kept them among the top of all funds for the long haul.  Putnam Cos. officials say the George Putnam Fund of Boston continues to follow the balanced investment approach of its founder, George Putnam, who co-managed the fund from 1937 to 1956.  This involves a portfolio relatively evenly divided between stocks and bonds.  If investors wanted to know who runs the fund, a Putnam official says, they could easily find out.  The portfolio managers are mentioned in the fund's periodic reports.  But so is George Putnam, the founder's son and current chairman.  "When the name of the fund and the chairman is the same, it certainly could be confusing, but I question whether the shareholder has any difficulty finding out the information given how clear it is," the Putnam official says.  The 30-odd Templeton funds, many of which have racked up impressive gains over the years, aren't actively run by John Templeton.  Mr. Templeton says he approves everything bought or sold by the funds.  But he contends that most shareholders know that the day-to-day management is handled by a staff of 400 people in eight nations.  "I'm the coordinator of investment research and portfolio management, but most of the work is done by others," he says.  James Benham, for his part, says his bond portfolios "aren't guru funds."  He notes that there isn't much room for individual judgment in the Benham zero-coupon bond funds: The funds invest all their money in zero-coupon Treasury bonds that mature in a set year, at which point the assets will be distributed to shareholders and the fund dissolved. (Zero-coupon bonds, which don't pay interest, are sold at a deep discount to their face value.)  Mr. Benham says portfolio managers aren't even allowed to raise fund cash levels if they're bearish, for instance, or leverage the fund if they're bullish.  "It's a matter of following instructions," he says.  CABLE: E.W. Scripps Co. agreed in principle to buy nine cable-TV systems in the Knoxville and East Tennessee area for about $100 million.

Intelligent Electronics Inc., Exton, Pa., said it completed its purchase of Connecting Point of America Inc. for as much as $54 million in cash and stock.  Intelligent Electronics said the new acquisition, coupled with its Entre Computer Centers and Todays Computers Business Centers subsidiaries, makes the company the largest computer dealer organization in the U.S., with more than 700 individual outlets.  Connecting Point, based in Denver, has 305 stores.  Connecting Point will remain an autonomous subsidiary until March 31, 1991.  Intelligent Electronics paid $24 million in cash and stock for the company, and Connecting Point holders will get as much as $30 million more based on the company's financial performance between now and 1991.  The Internal Revenue Service has demanded more than $2 billion in back taxes and interest from Texaco Inc. and Exxon Corp. relating to Saudi Arabian crude oil they purchased at below-market prices as long as a decade ago.  Both companies vowed to fight the IRS claim, which is the latest development in a long-running dispute.  Texaco was asked to pay $863 million in taxes and an estimated $925 million in interest connected with oil it bought during 1979, 1980 and 1981.  It was during those years that the IRS claims the four partners of the Arabian American Oil Co. -- Texaco, Exxon, Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp. -- enjoyed the "Aramco Advantage," which yielded them extraordinary profits.  The partners in those years were able to buy cheaply priced crude oil from Saudi Arabia even though oil prices world-wide were soaring as a result of the Iranian revolution.  Exxon said it was asked to pay additional taxes of $269 million for 1979 only.  An Exxon spokeswoman said the figure doesn't include interest because "Exxon and its counsel are convinced the company will win this dispute."  Interest could double the amount the IRS seeks.  The Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that the IRS is still auditing its 1980 and 1981 returns.  The government claims weren't a surprise.  The IRS indicated several years ago that it would probably demand additional taxes relating to the unusual Saudi oil deals.  And the oil firms have disputed the IRS argument ever since it was first advanced.  Yesterday, Exxon said it has already filed a petition challenging the IRS in the U.S. Tax Court in Washington.  Texaco said it will file a petition within the 90-day deadline.  The claim against Texaco was actually viewed by some analysts as good news.  When Texaco was emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings several years ago, the IRS estimated it might claim as much as $6 billion.  That estimate covered audits that spanned at least 20 years, but more than $2 billion of the figure was thought to pertain to the Aramco Advantage.  Texaco said it has put aside money against the IRS claims but wouldn't say how much.  The timing of the claim against Exxon, however, isn't advantageous.  The oil giant is currently trying to clean up its huge Alaskan oil spill, which will cost it at least $850 million.  Exxon is in the strongest financial condition of any U.S. oil company, so the IRS claim even in the context of the Alaskan cleanup "isn't unduly onerous," said William Brown III, oil analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Co.  But it comes at a time Exxon is embroiled in controversy over the cleanup and its public image has been taking a beating.  Spokesmen for Mobil and Chevron confirmed that their companies' taxes for the years involved are currently being audited, but said they haven't been notified of any specific IRS claims.  Chevron doesn't expect its audit to be completed for another year, its spokesman said.  Chevron called the IRS tax theory "without merit" and said it would fight any claim.  Mobil would only say that "it is confident it doesn't have a tax liability" regarding the IRS inquiry.  The dispute involves the sale of contract crude oil by Saudi Arabia to the Aramco partners from 1979 through 1981.  Oil prices climbed sharply after the Shah of Iran was deposed and Iranian oil production was temporarily limited.  Oil producers were charging as much as $40 a barrel, up from about $18.  In an effort to stabilize the market, Saudi Arabia sold its crude to the four Aramco partners at $4 to $6 below market levels.  But the kingdom mandated that such crude oil couldn't be resold to customers or affiliates at a higher level that would have yielded a windfall profit to the partners.  Much of the crude oil was resold to Aramco affiliates, which in turn refined it into products.  The IRS, according to the oil companies, now alleges that when the companies resold the oil to these affiliates for refining, they should have charged them the full market price.  But because the refining operations had obtained the crude feedstock so cheaply, they were able to reap huge profits when they sold the final products.  Many of those affiliates were located overseas, so foreign governments, not the U.S., taxed those profits.  According to Chevron general tax counsel John J. Ross, the IRS is arguing that some of those overseas profits are really attributable to the trading of oil rather than wholly to actions of the refining and marketing units.  If the IRS succeeds in pinning some of the profits on U.S.-based trading, those operations would then owe the U.S. government extra taxes.  Oil companies strongly object to that theory.  "There is no question that the Saudi Arabian government would have reduced its supplies to us if we had violated their directive to sell at lower prices," said William D. O'Brien, vice president and general tax counsel at Exxon.  "Moreover, the U.S. government sought and supported the Saudi position of lower crude prices during this period of sharply escalating world oil prices."  Also, if the IRS prevails, the oil companies could end up paying taxes twice on the profits from the products sold.  That's because the tax years involved have been closed in most other countries.  So, there would be no way to recover the foreign taxes already paid to offset the additional U.S. taxes.  Peter Kaiser, 50 years old, was named general manager of this computer maker's Commodore Buromaschinen G.m.b.H. subsidiary in West Germany, succeeding Winfred Hoffman, who resigned.  Mr. Kaiser had been manager of European distribution strategy and channel management at Compaq Computer Corp.  The Mexican government said it would offer tax breaks to investors who repatriate money they had transferred abroad.  The move is an effort to recoup some of the estimated $50 billion Mexico has lost by capital flight during its eight-year economic crisis.  Deposits taken abroad before 1985 would be taxed at a rate of 5%.  Deposits taken abroad during 1985 would be taxed at a rate of 3.7%.  Deposits taken abroad after 1985 wouldn't be taxed at all.  Those rates represent substantial savings from the country's capital-gains tax, which had applied in the past to returned overseas deposits.  The government said that it would ensure anonymity of all who repatriate capital.  Economists praised the tax-inducement package as a salutary complement to the new Mexican administration's economic reform program.  But they added that a tax break was unlikely in itself to stimulate a large inflow of capital.  They noted that the primary reason investors keep their money outside of Mexico is fear for the stability of the peso, not high taxes.  Joyce Wouters, a management consultant, joined this stock and options exchange as vice president, communications, succeeding Karen J. Kessler, 33 years old, who had been on leave and recently joined Jim Florio's New Jersey gubernatorial campaign as finance director.  With Chairman Dan Rostenkowski continuing to make little headway selling his capital-gains tax-cut proposal, the House Ways and Means Committee is unlikely to act on the controversial issue before September.  House Democrats proved to be deeply divided on the issue during a caucus on the subject yesterday.  And Republicans on the tax-writing panel, after meeting with Rep. Rostenkowski, declined to back away from a separate plan that would reduce the capital-gains tax rate.  As a result, the Illinois Democrat said there was only a "slight chance" he will reconvene the committee before the House is scheduled to adjourn tomorrow for a month-long break.  Negotiations are expected to continue behind closed doors, however.  Rep. Rostenkowski's proposal would remove from taxation that part of a gain that is attributable to inflation.  This inflation indexing would apply to assets acquired after July 31 and held for a year or more.  After five years, taxpayers would have another, novel option.  For assets sold after five to 10 years, the taxable gain, as an alternative to inflation adjustment, could be 75% of the price at which the asset is sold.  After 10 years, the taxable gain could be 50% of the sale price.  The alternative would be attractive to taxpayers with particularly large gains.  Assets covered by the Rostenkowski plan include corporate stock, real estate, timber and tangible assets used in a trade or business.  It wouldn't cover collectibles, preferred stock, stock of foreign corporations and bonds and debt instruments.  Rep. Rostenkowski didn't present his proposal in detail to the caucus but indicated that he hoped to negotiate a compromise.  The difficulty of finding a middle ground was underscored by the diversity of opinion expressed by his colleagues in the lengthy, closed session.  Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) presented the leadership's position, which is to strongly oppose a cut in the capital-gains tax rate on the ground that a cut would lose revenue over time and would disproportionately benefit the rich.  But he backed away from earlier assertions by leading Democrats that opposition to the cut was a keystone position for the Democratic Party.  Advocates of the cut saw this statement as an indication that he feared their proposal would prevail with strong Democratic support if the issue came to a vote in the House.  A plan that would cut the top capital-gains tax rate, which currently is as high as 33%, has been proposed by Democratic Rep. Edgar Jenkins of Georgia.  Backed by President Bush, Mr. Jenkins is among six Democrats and 13 Republicans who now hold a one-vote majority in the Ways and Means Committee.  Rep. Rostenkowski tried to interest the Republicans on his committee in his inflation-related capital-gains plan.  But the GOP lawmakers said they were sticking with the Jenkins plan, at least for now.  "There are a lot of objections to it," Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the committee's senior Republican, said of the chairman's proposal.  "It's clearly not something we want to reach out and grab."  Mr. Archer said that more negotiation is needed, particularly since the Bush administration hasn't embraced the Rostenkowski plan.  But late yesterday afternoon, the committee Republicans met with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman, and lawmakers came away thinking that a compromise, eventually, was possible, with indexing as its base.  "There was a desire to work with the chairman on something that everybody can accept," said Rep. Rod Chandler (R., Wash.).  Greyhound Corp. said its bus-building unit received an order for 96 luxury inter-city coaches from Taiwan with a total value of $13 million.  The company said it has sold 260 similar buses to Taiwan over the past 11 years.  The federal probe of commodity trading appears to have cleared one of its biggest hurdles: cracking one of the proudest pits at the Chicago Board of Trade.  After battling for seven months against traders in the soybean pit at the Chicago Board of Trade, U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas indicted 19 soybean traders.  Mr. Valukas induced at least four of them to cooperate, almost guaranteeing there will be more indictments to come in this city's largest agricultural trading pit.  Cooperation gives the government more witnesses to possible crooked trades, in addition to the undercover FBI agent who first posed as a trader more than two years ago.  Defense attorneys say the government might persuade other traders to make deals.  In targeting soybean traders, Mr. Valukas is tearing at the guts of a market that got its start seven years before the 46-year-old prosecutor was born.  In many ways, that soybean market is the heart of the institution that began when 82 merchants met above a Chicago flour store in 1848.  It's a place where board Chairman Karsten Mahlmann stops to chat during morning walks on the oak floors.  It's a place where top brokerage executives still wade in to buy or sell a few contracts.  It's a place where sons follow their fathers into the business, and old hands introduce favored youngsters.  Once there, traders are bound together by the arcane nature of buying and selling things they'll never see nor touch, brokering trades for people they'll never meet and taking more risk in a day than many people do in a lifetime.  Standing cheek-by-jowl all day, traders know each other "better than your own wife," says Jacob Morowitz, a soybean trader and president of a brokerage firm for independent traders.  Today, it's a pit at war, with some longtime traders fighting both the prosecutor and former colleagues.  John N. Eggum, a former wheat trader who moved over to beans when the soybean market got hot last year, has agreed to plead guilty to two counts of mail fraud, to give up trading forever and to testify against fellow traders.  At least three other bean traders have also agreed to cooperate.  "Everybody's concerned" about the government's investigation, one trader said quietly before the start of trading yesterday morning.  "It's scary.  You know a lot of people."  The soybean fraternity has been shattered by the defection in the past few days of Mr. Eggum, who stopped trading and sold his seat after news of the investigation broke last January.  One of many Board of Trade veterans who made mid-life career changes to become futures traders, the 47-year-old trader early on was considered a prime target of the investigation.  Now that he's made his deal, the question is what he'll tell the government about fellow traders.  Mr. Eggum and his attorneys have declined to comment.  To crack the pits, Mr. Valukas took a lesson from a government investigation of trading in the 1970s.  This time, he sent four FBI agents into the pits, wired to record the voices of other traders.  In the soybean pit, the job went to Richard Ostrom, who posed under the name Richard Carlson.  A balding, stocky man fond of conservative ties, his button-down style blended perfectly with that of the bean traders.  Like other newcomers, he went through a period when established traders kept their distance.  But his initiation seemed shorter than most.  He was friendly, "a guy you could very easily trust," a grain trader said at the time.  The unmasking of Mr. Carlson and other government moles came in January as the government went on the offensive, serving subpoenas to dozens of traders.  It culminated with yesterday's indictments.  "It's like being shafted by a pretty girl," says Frederick G. Uhlmann, a Rodman & Renshaw commodities executive, said in an interview earlier this year.  "They thought he was one of them, and he turned out to be a spy."  Until this year, Mr. Eggum was much like any other trader in the grain-trading fraternity, known to each other but not the outside world.  Now, he's key to the government's success in going after alleged wrongdoing in the bean pit.  After graduating from high school in 1960, Mr. Eggum worked at an amusement park and then bought a bar in DeKalb, Ill.  According to George Stratton, a onetime business partner, Mr. Eggum soon married, had children and decided to settle down.  Mr. Eggum sold the bar and borrowed money to buy a seat at the Board of Trade in 1978.  Mr. Eggum traded in the wheat pit, and then last year during the drought-inspired soybean rally, moved over, fellow traders say.  He did a good deal of trading with a broker named Martin J. Dempsey Jr.  That ended when the government made surprise visits to both men's homes.  Mr. Dempsey sold his membership Jan. 19; Mr. Eggum sold his a day later.  Mr. Dempsey was charged with conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, known as RICO, 37 counts of mail and wire fraud, and 83 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act.  Defense lawyers said from the beginning that Mr. Dempsey was a prime target of the investigation.  Now 52, he was an altar boy at Chicago's Loyola Academy prep school, where classmates included future achievers such as Neil F. Hartigan, now attorney general of Illinois, and Bill Plante, now a newsman at CBS.  Mr. Dempsey was a long-time member of the grain-traders club.  After college and a year of law school, he went to the Board of Trade, moving from clerk to phone man, finally to grain broker.  If an invisible hand assisted, that was part of the game.  "The Board of Trade was very Irish, and if you were Irish, they watched out for you a little bit," says a former grain trader.  Most bean traders wouldn't talk about the government's investigation before the 9:30 a.m. start of trading yesterday.  To do so would violate a new, unwritten rule in the traders' code of honor: don't be seen talking with outsiders.  Barely five hours later, many were charged with cheating customers or helping brokers cheat customers in commodity trades.  James D. Nowak took his normal post at the top step.  Hands in the pockets of his navy trading smock, he chatted with fellow traders.  A former commercial lending officer at Continental Bank here and later an official of the Board of Trade's processing arm, he started trading in 1978.  Mr. Nowak was charged with conspiracy under RICO, 56 counts of mail and wire fraud, and 180 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act.  A few steps away, Sheldon H. Schneider peered through his black-rimmed glasses at fellow traders below.  The quiet, gum-chomping independent trader joined the Board of Trade in 1976 after a decade in sales at a local food company.  "Time to better oneself," he wrote when he registered with the industry's regulatory group.  Mr. Schneider, 46, was charged with conspiracy under RICO, four counts of mail fraud and five counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act.  Twenty-eight-year-old Bradley S. Ashman was also there, as he's been since graduating in 1983 from the University of Illinois with a degree in marketing.  Mr. Ashman was charged with RICO conspiracy, 13 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act and one count of lying to a federal agency.  Also among those indicted was a 20-year grain broker, Bruce W. Mittelstadt.  Mr. Mittelstadt, 49, was charged with RICO conspiracy, 16 counts of wire fraud, 39 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act and one count of lying to a federal agency.  Other traders and some outside customers have said they regard Mr. Mittelstadt as one of the straightest-arrows in the bean pit.  Traders claim he was pressured by the government after committing a minor infraction: executing a trade for Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a big food processor, after the close.  In the traders' view, Mr. Mittelstadt's only crime was to be a good broker for his customers, and his misfortune was to stand near Mr. Carlson.  Mr. Mittelstadt's lawyer, James Montana, says, "When the jury hears all the facts, they will see that Bruce Mittelstadt cheated no one and always acted honorably and honestly."  Mr. Dempsey's son said the former trader had no comment.  Mr. Nowak's attorney, James Streicker, said they intend to enter a plea of innocent and to contest the charges.  George Collins, an attorney for Mr. Ashman, said his client "denies he's guilty of any of the charges."  Mr. Schneider and his attorney couldn't be reached for comment.  With the defection of Mr. Eggum, traders wonder who else might turn out to be a snoop.  Two traders who cooperated with the government in a smaller investigation of trading in the late 1970s earned the undying scorn of fellow traders.  "Your word is your bond down there," says a 79-year-old former soybean broker, explaining why he pleaded guilty to a crooked trade in 1979 but wouldn't think of testifying against fellow traders.  Today, he's one of the few in this city to consider both "Tony" Valukas and soybean traders his close friends.  Then an aggressive defense attorney, Mr. Valukas defended the broker and other bean traders in the long-running investigation in the 1970s.  "He got some experience from my case, I'll tell you that," the former broker says.  ---  Barbara Marsh contributed to this article.  The over-the-counter market advanced fractionally on moderately heavy volume.  The Nasdaq Composite Index, which flirted Tuesday with its record high of 455.26, didn't reach that level yesterday, closing up 0.79 at 454.08.  About 130.2 million shares were traded.  That was busier than the OTC market's July average of 122.4 million shares a day.  May was the busiest month so far this year, with a daily average of 140 million shares.  As the Nasdaq composite hovers near its closing high, some traders and analysts are sounding a cautious note, counseling investors to buy selectively.  Christine Callies, senior market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, predicted in May the Nasdaq composite's June slide.  She is still cautious about the OTC market, forecasting that the composite index will rise to around 460 and then become "vulnerable" to another correction.  Ms. Callies said that although the composite is approaching record levels, its performance relative to other indexes has been deteriorating since mid-May.  Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now are outperforming the Nasdaq composite for this year.  Ms. Callies also noted that the spread between the number of advancing issues and declining issues on the OTC market continues to be slim.  "I don't think that's going to change anytime soon," Ms. Callies said.  "The best trading spot is probably in some laggard New York {Stock Exchange issue} rather than in the OTC market."  Big financial issues fared better yesterday than most other sectors.  The Nasdaq Financial Index gained 1.55 to 449.75, while the Nasdaq 100 Index of large nonfinancial issues just about stood still, rising 0.01 to 425.68.  Buoyed by the sale of a one million-share block, Spear Financial Services rose 1/2 to 3 on 1.2 million shares.  It was the fourth most active stock on Nasdaq.  The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles M. Spear, told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that J. Anthony Forstmann, managing director of Forstmann-Leff Associates, sold his 15.7% stake in Spear to a unit of Liberty Mutual Insurance.  Falconbridge jumped 21% on news that Amax bid 2.85 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.42 billion), or C$36.125 a share, to acquire the Toronto miner of nickel, copper and cobalt.  Falconbridge, whose shares rose 5 1/2 to 31 1/4, said its board approved the offer and recommends that shareholders accept it.  Amax said the offer is conditioned on acceptance by holders of at least two-thirds of the shares outstanding, receipt of Canadian and U.S. regulatory approvals and certain other terms.  Ask Computer Systems slipped 1 3/4 to 12 1/2 on 812,500 shares.  The company reported that earnings for its fourth quarter, ended June 30, were $4.8 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with $4 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier.  Revenue improved to $54.8 million from $46.5 million.  For the year, the company earned $13.5 million, or $1 a share, compared with $10.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $186.3 million from $142.4 million.  ASK also agreed to acquire Data 3 Systems for $19 million.  Data 3 is a closely held Santa Rosa, Calif., company that develops and sells integrated manufacturing software systems and support services.  Legent rose 5/8 to 29 1/8.  The maker of software products said it signed a letter of intent to merge with closely held Business Software Technology, Westborough, Mass., in a stock transaction with a current market value of $47 million.  Terms call for Legent, which already owns 9.1% of Business Software, to issue about 1,480,000 shares for the remainder of the company.  Dow Jones & Co. named Danforth W. Austin to the post of circulation director for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine, effective Sept. 5.  Mr. Austin, 42 years old, is currently director of corporate relations for the publishing company.  He will function as deputy to Dorothea Coccoli Palsho, vice president of circulation.  Succeeding Mr. Austin as head of corporate relations is his deputy, Roger B. May, 58.  Robert J. Boehlke, executive vice president, was named to the new post of chief operating officer of this maker of industrial image automation systems.  The futures industry's worst nightmare began to unfold yesterday as federal law-enforcement officials announced felony indictments against 46 traders from this city's two big commodities exchanges.  Several of those charged are already telling prosecutors what they know about fellow traders, and the spreading investigation seems likely to join insider trading on Wall Street and the looting of the nation's savings and loans as one of the most troubling financial scandals of the 1980s.  If proved, the government's case would make plain that for many years, outside investors who used the futures markets were sitting ducks and often were picked off by hard-edged brokers and traders in the pits.  In essence, law-enforcement officials charged yesterday that these traders turned the pits into their own private back rooms, where profitable trades were divvied up among insiders and losses were passed along to outsiders.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Japanese-yen pit was hit hardest, by 21 indictments, including some major brokers.  The Chicago Board of Trade's soybean pit came next, with 19 indictments, many against longtime grain traders.  Moreover, the prosecutors appear to be just beginning their work in the Merc's Swiss-franc and the Board of Trade's Treasury-bond pits; each was hit with only three indictments.  The government's aim: a total of more than 100 indictments at both exchanges.  No trial dates are set.  In the indictments, filed in federal district court in Chicago, the government charged that a variety of illegal trading practices were used to steal money from customers.  In the Merc's yen pit, the government alleged, illicit profits even changed hands in the form of cash.  Among the likely victims are tens of thousands of individual traders and participants in professionally managed commodity funds.  For the two exchanges, which months ago began a vigorous campaign to protect their largely self-regulated status, the charges have inflicted a black eye, with many more rounds to go before they know the full extent of the government's case.  If found guilty, some of the traders could face lengthy prison terms, big fines and loss of property.  At an overflow news conference here, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and other federal officials were careful not to criticize the exchanges themselves and noted that only individuals have been charged.  However, Anton R. Valukas, the U.S. Attorney in Chicago, said in an interview that the exchanges "ought to be as concerned as we are with maintaining the integrity of the process."  According to lawmen familiar with his thinking, Mr. Valukas views the exchanges' regulatory performance as falling far short of acceptable standards.  The exchanges say their enforcement efforts are rigorous and adequate.  The indictments could carve a large hole in parts of the nation's two biggest futures exchanges.  The 21 yen traders named in this initial wave of indictments represent about a fifth of that pit's regular population, and the 19 soybean traders make up about 10% of that pit's rolls -- and probably a much larger proportion of trading volume.  More traders in those pits are likely to be indicted in the future.  The government charged more than a third of the traders under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, and some of them face immediate government claims on their assets.  Most of alleged thefts involve a few thousand dollars at a time.  But over time, such practices could carve millions of dollars out of the market at the expense of investors.  More difficult to assess, as in Wall Street's insider-trading scandal, is the damage to confidence in the markets.  Six of the indicted traders -- Martin J. Dempsey, James D. Nowak and Charles W. Bergstrom in the Board of Trade's soybean pit, and John M. Baker Jr., Sam Cali and Thomas Crouch in the Merc's yen pit -- are highlighted in the indictments as ringleaders and face especially harsh penalties under RICO.  They not only face the forfeiture of their exchange seats if they are convicted, as do all traders charged under RICO; their trading profits and brokerage commissions earned while the allegedly illicit trades were being made also would be seized by the government if they are found guilty.  Forfeitures from some of these traders could exceed $1 million.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said eight of the indicted traders are cooperating with the investigation and settled administrative charges that the CFTC lodged against them.  In the past few days, moreover, several additional traders have decided to cooperate and provide evidence against fellow exchange members, traders say.  The government's most successful FBI agent-turned-trader worked in the soybean pit, and the indictments of traders there are filled with allegations of stealing.  On one trade on June 9, 1988, it is alleged, Mr. Dempsey "intentionally created" a trading mistake to pass a $29,700 trading loss from his personal account to that of Richard Ostrom, an agent posing as trader Richard Carlson.  According to the government, Mr. Dempsey intended to pay back the agent with money "skimmed" from Mr. Dempsey's customers.  The 400 pages of indictments, however, leave open many questions about the quality of the government's case.  In the Merc's yen pit, one of the nation's biggest foreign-exchange trading arenas, the government alleges a huge five-year scheme to defraud customers but discloses almost nothing about specific trades or money transfers.  Tensions were high this week at the two exchanges, which normally resemble playgrounds of capitalism, as the names of cooperating traders filtered out and some colleagues realized they were trapped in the government's net.  Mr. Baker, normally one of the Merc's biggest pranksters, was seen by several traders sobbing on the exchange floor Tuesday.  While two brothers, Brian E. and James G. Sledz, were widely known to be cooperating with prosecutors, only this week did yen-pit traders learn for certain that another of their peers, Thomas M. Braniff, was talking to the government.  All three men were charged with felonies and reached administrative settlements with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Their trading privileges were suspended for three years.  As trading closed yesterday at the Merc, many members gathered round the television set in the Limit Up bar to watch the government's news conference.  When a television crew entered to record the scene, a shouting match erupted, in language that would cost a trader a $500 fine on the exchange floor.  For now, Mr. Valukas and his staff will square off against traders' lawyers.  But the final outcome of the government's undercover operation could lie in a test of wills between the aggressive prosecutor and the exchange leaders -- Merc chieftain Leo Melamed and Board of Trade Chairman Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann.  The Board of Trade said yesterday it was too soon to comment on the government's specific charges.  But Mr. Mahlmann said in a statement, "Such charges reflect on us all.  The exchange and its {3,500} members will not tolerate a single instance of trading abuse in our markets."  Any trader pleading guilty to a felony will be barred from the exchange, he added.  The Merc said it would ask indicted brokers to "immediately cease from conducting all public customer business."  Futures brokerage firms are divided over whether they should continue to process trades for traders who have been indicted.  Although the indictments name only individual traders, Mr. Valukas's ultimate targets are the exchanges and their regulators.  He sees the Merc and Board of Trade as rife with corruption and arrogant about their ability to write their own rules, according to federal lawmen.  And although CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm stood next to him at yesterday's news conference, Mr. Valukas believes the CFTC abdicates to the exchanges far too much of its regulatory responsibility.  In his view, lawmen say, the case could last well into the 1990s -- with the ultimate result, besides prison terms for convicted traders, being that the exchanges and lawmakers would be forced to make major reforms.  Defense lawyers counter that the case will demonstrate mostly an excess of prosecutorial zeal.  Certainly, Mr. Valukas has played hardball from the start.  Subpoenas went out en masse for maximum scare, and were delivered to traders' homes with a uniform message: Confess or we will use RICO to take your homes, cars and money and send you to jail.  We have it all on tape.  Putting G-men in the pits wasn't cheap.  In addition to the huge sums spent to provide agents with the life styles of rich traders, funds were also lost in the market.  FBI agent Dietrich Volk, posing as Merc yen trader Peter Vogel, racked up trading losses of $83,116 last year.  Some traders are now cooperating with the government, while others have vowed to fight.  The exchanges have only begun the battle to maintain their independence.  The Board of Trade's Mr. Mahlmann recently warned his members: "Our industry and indeed everything we stand for has been tainted with the scent of scandal.  And believe me, there's wolves at the door that have smelled that scent."  "Our ability," Mr. Mahlmann said, "to write our own rules is at stake."  The exchanges, privy to much of the information subpoenaed by prosecutors, could quickly see the direction of the government investigation.  Their parallel inquiries slowed the government's work, lawmen contend.  "People suspected of cooperating {with prosecutors} were isolated by the exchanges very early on," one official says.  "It was a very savvy move.  It gives some backbone to those who otherwise might want to cooperate.  It has been troublesome."  The exchanges also launched public-relations efforts.  The Merc quickly formed a panel to recommend ways to clean up trading abuses, and it set up classes for new members on a timely topic: ethics.  Meanwhile, exchange officials started Washington damage-control efforts within hours of the disclosure of the investigation last Jan. 19.  The exchanges, which are among the biggest financial contributors to members of Congress, have been meeting frequently with legislators.  "Just as Cash and I made 27 trips to Washington in 1988," Board of Trade President Thomas R. Donovan recently told members, "we expect to get there one or two days a week for the rest of this year."  The Merc, in particular, also set about to show that it isn't lax in enforcing rules.  In a move that has angered prosecutors, it launched disciplinary cases against some of its members for trades made with the FBI agents who posed as traders.  Mr. Valukas earlier warned the exchange that such internal investigations could interfere with his own. (The Board of Trade says that so far it isn't pursuing such cases in deference to Mr. Valukas.)  The Merc reopened part of a major disciplinary case in its stock-index pit that had been settled just days before the federal investigation became known.  It has since added further charges in that case and is expected to stiffen earlier penalties.  In coming days, as Mr. Valukas tries to stake his claim to some traders' assets under the RICO statutes, he may clash with the exchanges over money as well.  Control over some indicted traders' exchange seats, worth as much as $500,000 each, will probably be sought by both the government and the exchanges.  Board of Trade general counsel Scott Early, anticipating the clash, says legal precedent puts him ahead of the Internal Revenue Service and everyone else.  "I don't think RICO changes that at all," he says.  If indictments reach 100 traders, $30 million or more in seat proceeds could be at stake.  Defense lawyers said the government, for now, is offering not to seize seats so long as traders don't try to sell them and collect the money.  ---  Robert L.

An earlier edition incorrectly identified Encor as a TransCanada unit.

The bulk of the homes, 42, will be purchased by Tendercare Nursing Homes of Ontario, Canada.  The buyers of the other homes are Bixby Hospital, Resthaven Patrons and CCG Inc., all of Michigan.  Of the 45 nursing homes, 24 are leased by Beverly.  The homes have a total of 5,808 beds.  Included in the total are 21 homes that are being sold for almost $44.4 million by Nationwide Health Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust that owns some nursing homes that Beverly operates.  After a boardroom struggle, Integrated Resources Inc. turned over the chairman's post to Stephen Weinroth, a senior officer of the company's longtime investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  Mr. Weinroth, who has been on Integrated's board since 1983, succeeds Selig Zises, an Integrated founder, who remains a director of the troubled financial-services concern.  Integrated defaulted on its bank loans and commercial paper in June, and Drexel is trying to keep Integrated out of bankruptcy court by restructuring the company's total debt of about $1.8 billion.  People close to Integrated say Mr. Weinroth's election was bitterly opposed by Mr. Zises and some of Integrated's inside and outside directors.  These people say Mr. Weinroth was elected at Tuesday's board meeting of nine directors with a split vote but gained five votes in support of his election.  Mr. Weinroth is said to have abstained from voting, leaving three Integrated directors who either opposed him or abstained.  The dissident outside directors apparently feel that Drexel, as Integrated's investment banker and creditor, might have conflicting interests in restructuring the company's debt and might not be totally fair to Integrated's junior bondholders.  Some dissident Integrated directors were hoping to bring in an outsider as chairman of Integrated.  Their candidate was the retired chairman of a large insurance concern.  "The feeling was, he would give stability to the company," says a person close to Integrated's board.  Arthur Goldberg, who continues as Integrated's president and chief executive officer, said Mr. Weinroth has been active at Integrated since its liquidity problems arose and that his new post is "more reflective of reality" at the company today.  Mr. Zises and his two brothers sold most of their stake in Integrated last winter to insurer I.C.H. Corp. before Integrated's cash crisis and haven't been active at the company for some time.  The departure of Mr. Zises, who customarily declines to speak with the press, had long been expected.  Integrated is a major commercial-paper and junk-bond client of Drexel, so the firm has a strong interest in the company's survival.  Drexel also has extended a $30 million loan to the company.  Integrated's creditors will meet Aug. 15 to discuss Drexel's restructuring plan.  Mr. Weinroth's appointment immediately touched off speculation on Wall Street that the executive might be about to leave Drexel and is looking for a home at Integrated.  Mr. Weinroth wasn't available for comment.  But one Integrated director says Mr. Weinroth isn't planning to leave Drexel.  He says Integrated's board will make sure that Drexel's restructuring plan is fair to everyone.  Integrated shares rose 50 cents each to $2.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  According to R.D. Smith & Co., which trades the securities of troubled companies, Integrated's commercial paper is trading at about 40 cents on the dollar; its senior bonds are in the low 40s and its junior bonds are in the low 20s.  Some Integrated directors still are hoping to improve upon Drexel's restructuring plan, says a person close to the board.  He says "a big blue-chip company" currently is looking at Integrated's books and might want to take charge of the restructuring.  If it did so, he says, the "blue-chipper" would lend $300 million to Integrated to tide it over its problems.  Drexel's plan also would involve raising $300 million of borrowed money for Integrated.  Part of the loan might be in the form of a bridge loan from Drexel.  Meanwhile, Integrated's creditors are at loggerheads.  Analysts say it might be tough for Drexel to get them to agree on a restructuring plan outside of the bankruptcy court.  Mr. Weinroth built up Drexel's commercial paper group.  These short-term IOUs are a big business for Drexel and the market requires special care because it is very vulnerable to shocks, such as Integrated's default.  Robert Miller, a lawyer for almost 50 institutional investors who hold about 70% of Integrated's public bonds, says, "junior bondholders are particularly concerned over the implications" of Mr. Weinroth's appointment.  He says his clients worry that Drexel, in restructuring Integrated's debt, might give junior bondholders a raw deal, while putting its best efforts into bailing out commercial paper holders.  To restructure outside of bankruptcy court, Integrated requires 100% assent from senior creditors but in some circumstances only 66% assent from junior bondholders.  However, says one analyst, Drexel was the investment banker for all of Integrated's debt, senior and junior.  "They have friends at every level" that they must satisfy, the analyst said.  ---  Joan Lebow contributed to this article.  THE NET INCOME of LaSalle National Corp., a subsidiary of Algemene Bank Nederland N.V., doubled in 1988 to $28.4 million.  LaSalle's return on average equity at year end was 17.7%, up from less than 12% a year earlier.  In a previous edition, LaSalle's recent financial performance was incorrectly characterized.  (See: "Exchange Bancorp Set to Be Purchased by Dutch Concern" -- WSJ July 27, 1989)  The White House worked hard to impose a calm facade on the latest hostage crisis, but the effort masked growing frustration over a lack of precise information about the hostages and worry that diplomacy won't sway their captors.  With a terrorist group in Lebanon threatening to kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio today unless Israel releases a Moslem cleric it has kidnapped, the Navy began moving ships in the direction of Lebanon and Iran.  The U.S. has warned it will hold Iran responsible if its Lebanese followers harm Mr. Cicippio.  The U.S. has at least 23 warships in the Mediterranean and another carrier battle group steaming toward the Mideast, so President Bush will have practically every possible military option at the ready if force is needed in the hostage crisis.  The president and his aides played down the moves and emphasized that they are focusing on other government business.  Nevertheless, the administration continued frantic efforts to use diplomatic pressure to protect the hostages; it continues to send blunt diplomatic messages to Iran and Syria insisting that they use their influence over Mr. Cicippio's captors to save his life.  Administration officials acknowledged that any military options are severely limited by a shortage of hard information about where hostages are held in the shadowy world of Shiite-dominated southern Lebanon.  Moreover, there are no obvious bases or buildings where the U.S. can be sure important terrorist leaders reside or work.  Mr. Bush himself vented his frustration in a brief public comment to reporters.  "We're dealing with less than a full deck when it comes to information," Mr. Bush said.  "It is very hard when you're dealing with this kind of cowardice and this kind of dastardly act to get all the information that you need to make a decision. . . .  We are not dealing with all the facts."  The frustration is surfacing on Capitol Hill as well.  Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) questioned whether the U.S. had enough intelligence-gatherers in the Middle East.  And by a voice vote, the Senate adopted an amendment to the pending Pentagon spending bill requiring that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Central Intelligence Director William Webster report to Congress by Sept. 1 on efforts to locate and free the remaining hostages.  In the hostage crisis, the U.S. is facing its toughest intelligence problem -- how to penetrate small groups of terrorists who are often members of extended families, and to anticipate their moves.  American analysts say the hostages probably are being kept mostly in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a lawless region that hasn't had any government for several years.  "I'm sure they're terribly frustrated right now.  You want to get something done, but you can't because there's too much you don't know," says Clay McManaway, who until April 30 was the deputy to the chief of counter-terrorism at the State Department.  "The U.S. has never had precise information about the whereabouts of the captors and the hostages in time to act on it."  Despite the difficulties, though, Mr. Bush will find it hard to resist pressure for action if there is a credible claim that Mr. Cicippio is killed today, just three days after Shiite terrorists claimed to have killed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.  There seems little chance that Israel will defuse the situation by releasing Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Shiite cleric and a leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-inspired Shiite terrorist organization in south Lebanon, whose kidnapping set off the latest round of threats against hostages.  Releasing the sheik would appear to be a capitulation to Hezbollah and the terrorist cells related to it, and the U.S. emphasized that it isn't demanding that.  So the administration is escalating military preparations in case Mr. Bush decides to strike.  The battleship Iowa left its anchorage at Marseille yesterday and moved into the Mediterranean.  In addition, the Pentagon yesterday said another aircraft carrier, the America, cut short a port visit in Singapore and was heading to an undisclosed location with seven accompanying ships.  And the guided missile cruiser Belknap, flagship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, was diverted from a planned visit to the Black Sea.  The Navy never discloses the exact deployments of its ships, but Pentagon officials made it clear that these vessels were moving into positions where they could be used if needed in this crisis.  U.S. officials say those moves are precautionary and shouldn't be read as an indicator of imminent military steps to either free hostages or punish their captors.  The officials insist the U.S. focus is on diplomacy.  In the wake of the reported murder of Col. Higgins, the U.S. has sent messages to Iran's leaders saying it expects them to use their influence to prevent Shiite extremists from killing more hostages.  The U.S. has cast a wide diplomatic net, asking a variety of other nations to deliver the same message to Iran and to Syria, which controls the area where many of Lebanon's Shiite terrorist cells operate.  Still, U.S. officials could be playing down the possibility of military action to prevent tipping their hand to terrorist leaders.  Possible military options range from bombings and Marine amphibious landings to small "surgical strikes" by precision-guided cruise missiles or by commandos from a U.S. special forces unit.  The key player if military options are chosen will be Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has been arriving each morning at the White House carrying a large leather portfolio, the kind architects carry blueprints in.  Options and maps are prepared by the joint chiefs' Operations' Directorate, a body of planners that has been developing and updating military options in Lebanon for years.  According to senior defense officials, Adm. Crowe and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney agree on possible options and then present them to the National Security Council.  When it gets down to the details, Adm. Crowe's expertise and knowledge of the area could be be crucial.  In the mid-1970s, he headed the Navy's Middle East Task Force in the Persian Gulf.  Later, he was commander in chief of allied forces in southern Europe, which includes the Mediterranean.  "He really knows the nuts and bolts," commented one official.  ---  Walter S. Mossberg and John E. Yang contributed to this article.  Hurt by an unusually large number of claims, Central Reserve Life Corp. said it expects to post second-quarter earnings sharply lower than the $402,676, or 10 cents a share, earned a year earlier.  The Berea, Ohio, insurer said that a 30% rise in benefit payments will reduce earnings to an estimated $100,000.  That drop will mean that first-half profit will "be about level" with the $654,967, or 16 cents a share, earned a year earlier.  In the first quarter, Central Reserve earned $558,167, or 13 cents a share.  Fred Lick Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, termed the situation "temporary" and said that the ratio of claims to premiums fell in July to 60% from 76% in June.  The company expects to report results about Aug. 10.  London shares rose sharply to close at a post-crash high, mainly because of a strong rally on Wall Street during the London afternoon.  Tokyo stocks pushed past 35000 for the first time but fell back to close slightly firmer on the day.  In London, a lack of selling pressure and strong rallies in the store and pharmaceutical sectors also combined to push the market higher.  Share prices opened lower but rallied on news of an agreement between General Electric Co. PLC, Siemens and the British government under which the British and West German electronics giants may resume their joint bid for Plessey Co. PLC.  The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended up 15.5 points at 2307.8, a high for the day.  At its lowest, the index touched 2285.8, a fall of 6.5 points.  Dealers said volume wilted during the afternoon as the market tracked movements on Wall Street.  "It was a pretty volatile day, but it seemed the market wanted to rally after its declines earlier in the week," one trader said.  At the close, the narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 14.1 points at 1923.9.  Turnover was a slim 424.8 million shares, compared with 413.5 million shares Tuesday.  Barclays ended 6 pence (12 cents) lower at 505 pence ($8.41), after announcing that a hefty increase in provisions against loans to less developed countries had trimmed its interim pretax profit 8.1% to #590 million from #642 million a year earlier.  Barclays added #233 million to its provisions in the latest period.  News that General Electric and Siemens are free to make a new bid for Plessey pushed GEC's shares 2 pence higher to 270, while Plessey shares climbed 5 pence to 276 on volume of 5.5 million shares.  The stores sector attracted strong investor interest as players considered the "defensive" qualities of several stocks.  Among these, Kingfisher rose 9 pence to 366, Marks & Spencer jumped 7 pence to 218, Boots climbed 5 pence to 297, Great Universal Stores advanced 37 pence to #11.35, and Next rose 4 pence to 148.  Composite insurers also rallied after Tuesday's retreat.  Commercial Union rose 3 to 417, General Accident was up 5 to #10.02, and Royal Insurance climbed 4 to 418.  Pharmaceutical stocks extended their recent rally.  Glaxo, a company one dealer described as "the quality stock in the sector," rose 35 pence to #14.91.  Fisons rose 1 pence to 345, SmithKline Beecham jumped 8 pence to 576, and Wellcome rose 2 pence to 452.  Dealers said the sector continued to benefit from news last week of a major merger between U.S. pharmaceutical concerns Squibb and Bristol-Myers.  Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 issues closed up 0.88 points at 34899.34 after reaching a high of 35015.93 earlier in the day.  Tuesday, the index fell 55.41 points.  In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 6.15 points, to 34905.49.  Brokers said they expect the market to test new highs against the backdrop of lower oil prices, a stronger yen and signs of further easing in U.S. monetary policy.  The Nikkei has broken three closing records in the past two weeks.  The index finished at a record 34953.87 Monday.  But concern about the yen's rapid and volatile surge and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's failure to pick a new leader is temporarily putting a ceiling on the index below 35000, brokers said.  Volume in the first section was estimated at 800 million shares, up from 752 million shares Tuesday.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 476 to 428, while 188 issues remained unchanged.  The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which fell 1.28 points Tuesday, was up 5.62 points at 2633.24.  Brokers said securities houses trying to increase profits before September book closings attempted to push up the market with large buying orders in the morning session.  But they failed to draw enough investors into the market to support an afternoon rally.  Nippon Steel was heavily bought by one of the "big four" brokerage houses in the morning session, brokers said, but ended the day down 5 yen (4 cents) at 885 yen ($6.50).  Growing speculation about lower domestic interest rates helped financial stocks replace domestic-demand-related issues as the focus of investor interest, brokers said.  The latter -- leading the market since last week -- were lower at the close.  Among financial stocks, both larger and smaller-sized banks made gains.  Mitsui Bank was up 30 yen at 2,390.  Bank of Tokyo rose 40 yen to 1,770.  Sumitomo Bank gained 30 yen to 3,750.  Nonlife insurance stocks were also bought on the outlook for lower interest rates at home and abroad, brokers said.  Taisho Marine was up 20 yen at 1,550.  Tokio Marine gained 20 yen to 2,200.  Yasuda Fire & Marine advanced 20 yen to 1,550.  In Taipei, the market regained its strong momentum, lifting the Weighted Index 190.65 points to close at 9663.60.  In other Asian and Pacific trading, share prices closed higher in Sydney, Seoul and Wellington, mixed in Hong Kong and Manila and lower in Singapore.  In Frankfurt, share prices continued to rally in lively trading as foreign investors extended their chase for blue chips.  But the market ended below its day's highs on profit-taking.  Share prices in Paris steadily recovered from their early weakness to close slightly higher in thin trading, pushing the CAC index of French shares to a record 505.9.  Brussels stock prices rose strongly for the third consecutive day, pushing the market index over the 6,200 mark for the first time.  Share prices in Amsterdam closed mixed in active trading, with sufficient gains to nudge the market's main indicator to a high for the third day in a row.  Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Zurich, Stockholm and Milan.  South African gold stocks closed higher.  Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.

Last month, the government said it had found evidence of misconduct and failure to comply with British disclosure laws in the underwriting.  Mr. Cohen said that while his "conduct was completely exonerated" in the government report, the possibility of having to defend himself against Bank of England criticism, "with the attendant costs of further litigation, is too daunting."  SmithKline Beecham PLC's embattled ulcer drug Tagamet was dealt another blow in a new scientific report, but a silver lining in the study could ultimately rejuvenate the medication.  The report, by researchers at Rockefeller University, New York, is the first to explain previous studies that found that Tagamet causes annoying side effects in some men such as breast enlargement and reduced sex drive.  But the study also hinted that Tagamet may have a role in treating osteoporosis in women.  The side effect in men is rare -- occurring in about 2% of patients who use the drug for more than six months -- and it's reversible.  But Glaxo Holdings PLC of Britain has exploited the problem to help vault its own ulcer drug Zantac ahead of Tagamet in one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest marketing wars ever -- a battle of billion-dollar ulcer drugs.  The report doesn't alter the substance of that battle, but its prominent appearance as the lead study in today's New England Journal of Medicine is certain to be seen by doctors and to be used by SmithKline's competitors, including Glaxo and Rahway, N.J.-based Merck & Co., which markets Pepcid as an ulcer drug.  In their running battle, Glaxo and SmithKline each have exploited the publication of scientific studies supporting their own product or questioning the competitor's product.  The market for the drugs is so sensitive to the publication of such studies that in this case, New England Journal editors requested revisions to the study to ensure fairness, one of the authors said.  Tagamet, or cimetidine as it is known generically, and Zantac, or ranitidine, were the only drugs tested in the study.  The stakes are huge.  Tagamet hit the market in 1976 and quickly became the biggest-selling prescription drug in the world, peaking at sales of $1.13 billion in 1987.  Zantac was marketed by Glaxo in early 1980s and rapidly eclipsed Tagamet, partly on claims that it lacked some of Tagamet's side effects.  At the end of 1988, Zantac was the top-selling drug, with sales of about $2 billion a year.  Tagamet sales were about $1 billion last year, in the range of what the company expects for 1989.  The study's key finding is that Tagamet interferes with the body's ability to process the sex hormone, estrogen.  This interference causes a buildup of a form of estrogen that leads to the breast-enlargement problem in some men.  But for this same reason, the drug may be beneficial in preventing osteoporosis in women.  That disease, common in post-menopausal women and characterized by sometimes crippling bone loss, is caused by lack of estrogen.  "The side effect may actually have therapeutic value," said Jon J. Michnovicz, now medical director of the Institute for Hormone Research and co-author of the study with Richard A. Galbraith of Rockefeller University.  Studies are under way with post-menopausal women, Dr. Michnovicz said, and early indications are that women are affected in much the same way as men.  "The area is definitely wide open for discovery," he said.  In a statement, SmithKline said the study "doesn't contain new clinical information and doesn't conflict with current prescribing information for cimetidine."  The Philadelphia-based company also said that in addition to osteoporosis, the study shows Tagamet may also have potential in cancer treatment.  In the study, nine healthy men took 800-milligram doses of Tagamet twice a day, about double the normal clinical dose, for two weeks.  These volunteers had a 40% reduction in their ability to break down estradiol, a form of estrogen, and a 20% increase in blood levels of the hormone, the researchers found.  In a second phase of the experiment, six men were given more common clinical doses of 400 milligrams twice a day for one week.  These volunteers still had a 33% reduction in metabolizing the hormone.  By contrast, seven men who took 150 milligram doses of ranitidine daily for two weeks had no significant changes in processing the hormone, a finding that was expected because ranitidine hadn't previously been linked to the effects.  Tagamet and Zantac are known as H2 antagonists in that they help heal ulcers by blocking the action of histamine, a hormone-like chemical that triggers the release of stomach acid.  George W. Bush, the president's oldest son, said he won't run for the 1990 Texas Republican gubernatorial nomination.  Since his father's inauguration last January, Mr. Bush, 43 years old, had been stumping the state in preparation for a possible campaign.  He said he decided not to enter the race because of his responsibilities as a father of seven-year-old twins and as a managing partner of Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers, which Mr. Bush and a group of investors bought in March.  "I just didn't have the proper amount of fire in the belly right now," he said.  Mr. Bush said he hadn't decided whether to endorse any of the other Republican candidates.  Midland oilman Clayton Williams and former Texas secretary of state Jack Raines have already entered the race.  Also said to be considering candidacies are corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. and state railroad commissioner Kent Hance, an ex-Democrat who defeated Mr. Bush in a 1978 congressional race.  Mr. Bush didn't rule out seeking a political office in the future.  "I'm keeping that option open," he said.  The dollar finished moderately stronger, rebounding from the previous day's sell-off, as participants opted for more neutral positions ahead of U.S. employment data due tomorrow.  Foreign-exchange traders attributed the dollar's mild recovery to the covering of short-dollar positions by participants eager to lock in profits from the currency's recent decline.  They cautioned that prospects for the U.S. currency remain poor in the near future because of the potential for a new round of interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and concern that the slowing economy may trip into a recession.  In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8588 marks, up from 1.8510 marks Tuesday, and at 136.65 yen, up from 135.90 yen.  The pound was at $1.6552, down from $1.6650.  In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar opened for trading at 136.72 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 136.20 yen.  Tuesday's late dollar-selling spree carried over into early Asian trading yesterday.  The U.S. currency fell to almost 1.8430 marks before the appearence of new buyers triggered profit-taking by participants who had sold dollars during the currency's decline in the past few days.  The release of two relatively minor economic indicators, U.S. new home sales and factory orders, had little effect on the day's trading, dealers said.  Although home sales climbed higher than expected, the gains are largely a product of the lower interest rates that have been hampering the dollar, said Jeff Mondschein, managing director of foreign exchange at Continental Bank in Chicago.  Therefore, the increase is as much a signal of how far interest rates have fallen as it is a suggestion of increased economic activity, he said.  Sales of new single-family houses rose 5.5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000, following a revised 4.3% rise in the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000.  Economists, on average, had expected a 1.1% rise in home sales.  New factory orders in June rose 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted $234.56 billion, an expansion from the revised decrease of 2.6% in May and close enough to the predicted 0.3% to leave the market unflustered.  Likewise, the index of U.S. leading indicators for June, to be announced today, isn't expected to have much impact on foreign-exchange dealings.  The index, which is expected to have fallen 0.2%, is overshadowed by the employment report, traders said.  James McGroarty, senior vice president of foreign exchange at Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn., said the leading indicators "generally aren't a barometer of Fed monetary policy," which is the overriding focus of market participants now.  Traders said it would be premature to be concerned that the employment data will lead the Fed to trigger a new reduction in the federal funds rate, after a quarter-point easing last week.  The employment figures are expected to show 158,000 additions to non-farm payrolls and an unemployment rate unchanged from June at 5.3%.  Mr. McGroarty predicted that non-farm payrolls would have to grow by significantly less than 125,000 before the Fed would consider another easing so soon.  In addition, Mr. Mondschein said the Fed has to take more time to assess its recent series of interest rate cuts to ensure inflation won't rekindle.  Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar continued to benefit from the perception that it is the least troubled high-yielding currency, traders said.  The U.S. dollar slipped to 1.1753 Canadian dollars at the New York finish, down from 1.1761 Canadian dollars Tuesday.  On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 70 cents to $370.10 an ounce in light trading.  Estimated volume was 2.2 million ounces.  In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $369.70 an ounce.  Amax Inc. agreed to acquire Falconbridge Ltd. under a proposed tender offer valued at 2.85 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.42 billion), or C$36.125 a share.  The move would make Amax one of the world's six largest base-metal producers.  The surprise pact between Amax, a big Greenwich, Conn.-based aluminum, coal, and gold mining concern, and Falconbridge, a large producer of nickel, copper, and zinc, appears designed to thwart a yearlong creeping takeover of Falconbridge by Noranda Inc., a resource giant indirectly controlled by Toronto financiers Edward and Peter Bronfman.  In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Falconbridge's shares soared on the news, closing at US$31.125 each, up US$5.50 on volume of 561,200 shares.  In heavy Toronto Stock Exchange trading, Falconbridge closed at C$36.625, up C$6.375.  The Toronto closing price, 50 Canadian cents above Amax's bid price, reflected some investors' expectations that Noranda might make a counteroffer, alone or with another company.  But Noranda, which was told of Amax's bid, gave no indication of its intent.  "We're reviewing the options," said Alfred Powis, chairman and chief executive officer of Noranda, which currently owns 18.8 million, or about 24.9%, of Falconbridge's 75.8 million common shares outstanding and has said it seeks control of Falconbridge.  Mr. Powis said a counteroffer "may be a possibility," though Noranda also has "the option of laughing all the way to the bank" by tendering shares to Amax's bid, which he said would give Noranda a profit of about C$221 million on its shares.  Most analysts described Amax's offer as fair, and at least one large Falconbridge holder said he expects the offer to succeed.  "I think it's a fair price.  If I had to bet, I'd say they {Noranda} will tender their stock," said William Harnisch, president of New York's Forstmann-Leff Associates, an investment management firm that owns about 10 million Falconbridge shares, or 13.2% of its common.  Mr. Harnisch said "There's another 10% out there who I can think of, without blinking an eye," who will likely tender to Amax's offer.  Amax's hand is further strengthened by the block of 9.2 million Falconbridge shares that Toronto-based Falconbridge bought back last year.  Falconbridge's chairman, president, and chief executive officer, William James, himself a former Noranda executive, said the shares will be tendered to Amax's bid.  "It's a great offer, it's for all the shares, and it's all cash," said Mr. James, who began talks with Amax's chairman and chief executive officer, Allen Born, in late June.  People familiar with the deal said Mr. James "had been looking for somebody" to help fend off the advances of Noranda, which is mainly interested in acquiring Falconbridge's Kidd Creek zinc, copper, and silver operations in northern Ontario.  In announcing the Amax offer, which is subject to approval by regulators as well as holders of at least two-thirds of Falconbridge's common shares, Falconbridge also invoked a shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill," effectively blocking Noranda from adding more than 1% to its existing stake unless it makes a competing bid to all shareholders.  Noranda said it hasn't yet decided whether it will fight the "pill" in the courts.  The deal helped fuel speculation in other publicly-traded metal and mining company stocks.  Inco Ltd., a big nickel company, was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $1.625 to $33.75 on volume of 3.4 million shares.  Much of the Inco volume occurred when a Canadian securities firm, Gordon Capital Inc., traded a 2.8 million-share block at $33.75.  "We are not aware of who the ultimate owner is, or the seller," said an Inco spokesman.  "We don't have reason to believe right now that it isn't for passive investment."  Analysts said the purchase would be a good fit for Amax, which relies on aluminum for much of its earnings.  Mr. Born, who took over as president and chief executive of Amax in 1985, has instituted a major restructuring of the once-ailing company, shifting its focus from copper, iron ore, lead and nickel, among other metals, to aluminum, coal and gold, plus molybdenum.  If acquired, Mr. Born said, Falconbridge wouldn't be likely to add anything to Amax's earnings this year, but it could add as much as $100 million next year.  He estimated annual interest charges for the proposed purchase at about $200 million.  Mr. Born said Amax doesn't plan to sell any Falconbridge assets to help finance the purchase, which would raise Amax's debt level to about $3.5 billion from $1 billion, or to 56% of total capital from the current level of about 30%.  Mr. Born said permanent financing isn't yet in place, but Amax has received commitments from backers, and it doesn't expect to require a $1.5 billion loan guarantee that Merrill Lynch & Co.'s capital markets group -- dealer manager for the offer in the U.S. -- has agreed to provide.  Mr. Born said he doesn't yet know what role the feisty and independent-minded Mr. James would play in the combined company, but he noted that Mr. James is 61 years old.  "Hopefully, he'll play a strong role," he said.  Under the accord, Falconbridge also granted an option to Amax to acquire debentures convertible to 9.875 million Falconbridge shares at the bid price, subject to Amax acquiring 56% of Falconbridge's stock under its offer.  At least one analyst was skeptical about the Amax announcement.  "I don't see why anybody would buy a nickel company at the top of the market," said Ronald Shorr, metals analyst at Bear Stearns & Co. "Even producers are admitting this might be the first year in several years that inventories will increase.  I don't know where additional demand is going to come from."  He said "smart managements made acquisitions three years ago, when things were at their bottoms.  Amax looks like they've done the opposite.  I haven't been recommending the stock, but if I had been, I think I'd have egg on my face."  The transaction, he added, contradicts Mr. Born's efforts to improve the company's capital structure.  ---  Robin G.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.32 to 2657.44.  Blue chips led the market, and broader averages posted only slight gains.  The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed 0.59 higher at 344.34, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.40 to 191.78.  New York Stock Exchange volume was 181,760,000 shares.  Traders said a variety of futures-related strategies hit the market early and late.  As has been the pattern for several sessions, volume was heavy in the first hour of trading.  But this has been mainly due to stock-index arbitrage trading and not to buying from abroad, which is often the reason for an early volume surge, traders said.  "We've seen some buying from Swiss and Japanese accounts, but the rally has been domestically fed and bred," one trader said.  He said declining U.S. interest rates impose a currency risk for foreign investors, and that's keeping them cautious on U.S. stocks.  Traders said the market is becoming more volatile as the industrial average closes in on its all-time high of 2722.42 set in August 1987.  A number of skittish investors are taking profits as the market rises, but large buy orders emerge when stocks trade down.  "Every time one of my stocks falls, there is a bid that comes in," said James Gallagher, partner at the specialist firm Fowler & Rosenau.  Consequently, although many believe the market is due for a decline, it is difficult to bet on the sell side just yet.  Institutional accounts traded cautiously ahead of today's leading economic indicators for June and tomorrow's July employment data.  Big trading firms dominated activity in blue-chip stocks.  Speculation swirled around a number of metal and mining company stocks after Amax announced a bid for Falconbridge.  Inco was the Big Board's most active issue, rising 1 5/8 to 33 3/4 on volume of 3.4 million shares.  Gordon Capital traded a 2.8 millionshare block of Inco at 33 7/8.  "We are not aware of who the ultimate owner is, or the seller," an Inco spokesman said regarding the block trade.  "We don't have reason to believe that it is for anything but passive investment."  Among other metal shares, Cominco closed up 5/8 to 25 3/8, Asarco gained 1 1/8 to 31 1/4, Magma Copper rose 1/4 to 6 1/4, and Phelps Dodge added 1/4 to 66 3/8.  A number of copper producers raised their prices for the metal yesterday.  Investors will be analyzing the leading indicators report today for confirmation that the economy is slowing enough to warrant continued interest-rate declines but not so quickly as to damage corporate profits.  The index is expected to be down 0.2%, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones.  That would follow a 1.2% decline in May and a 0.6% rise in April.  In tomorrow's employment report, market expectations are that non-farm payrolls grew about 150,000 in July.  Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said any figure substantially below that would give a boost to the bond market and probably help stocks as well.  Ogden Projects, a new listing on the Big Board yesterday, closed at 18 1/8.  In an initial public offering, underwriters priced 2.5 million shares at $14 each.  The company specializes in the conversion of waste to energy.  Ogden Corp. retains ownership of 92% of Ogden Projects, or 32 million shares.  Walt Disney gained 4 7/8 to 114 5/8, on top of a 2 1/4 rise Tuesday.  The company said it plans to double the size of its new Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Orlando, Fla., within the next three years.  The park has been filled to capacity every day since it opened this spring.  Disney also has been rumored to be a possible target by those shopping for media and entertainment acquisitions.  Another entertainment concern, MCA, gained 1 1/2 to 67 5/8.  The company's stock has been moving higher since Paramount dropped its bid for Time Inc.  Many industry analysts speculate that Paramount, laden with cash to spend, will turn its attention to other entertainment companies.  Meanwhile, this newspaper reported that MCA is about to sign a contract with two of the industry's hottest comedy writers to develop sit-coms over the next three years.  Integrated Resources edged up 1/2 to 2 7/8 following word that Stephen D. Weinroth has been named chairman, succeeding Selig Zises.  Avon Products climbed 1 to 36 1/2.  Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs disclosed that he submitted a letter to the company offering to acquire it for $41 a share.  Kerr Glass gained 1 3/4 to 10 7/8 after reporting second-quarter net income of 61 cents a share, about double its year-ago earnings.  Tucson Electric Power tumbled 2 to 24 5/8.  Late Tuesday, the Arizona utility and financial services company reported a 30% plunge in second-quarter earnings and disclosed an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission of insider trading in its stock.  It also repeated warnings that the company might slash or eliminate the 97.5-cent quarterly dividend on its common stock.  The American Stock Exchange Index dropped 0.33 to 375.48.  Volume totaled 14,100,000 shares.  Home Shopping Network plunged 1 to 3 3/8.  In an unexpected reversal, a jury awarded GTE Corp. $100 million in a countersuit it had filed against the company and its two top officers.  Home Shopping originally sued GTE, charging it with fraud for providing a phone network that couldn't handle Home Shopping's needs.  GTE countersued for libel and won.  Fur Vault rose 1/4 to 4 1/2.  Centaur Partners II boosted its stake in the company to 16.81% from the 14.97% stake disclosed on Monday.  A bid by Nashville businessman Spencer Hays for Cluett Peabody & Co., the shirt manufacturing company owned by Farley Inc., has been rejected, according to executives close to the bidding.  Mr. Hays emerged in June as a partner of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in the union's effort to acquire Cluett Peabody through an employee stock ownership plan.  But the bid submitted by Mr. Hays didn't include the union as a joint bidder, persons close to the bidding said.  They said Mr. Hays's bid wasn't high enough to make it into the second round of bids in an auction being conducted by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  About 30 bids were received for Cluett, sources said.  It couldn't be learned how many companies were eliminated from this round of the auction process, nor what the value of Mr. Hays's bid was.  Mr. Hays's elimination from the bidding won't prevent the union from forming a partnership with another bidder, one source said.  It wasn't immediately clear why the union wasn't a joint bidder with Mr. Hays.  Neither Mr. Hays nor Jack Sheinkman, president of the union, could be reached for comment.  A spokesman for Farley, based in Chicago, didn't return phone calls.  Soybean futures skidded again in light trading, as participants awaited the Justice Department's announcement of indictments in its futures-market investigation.  Estimated soybean-futures-trading volume on the Chicago Board of Trade fell more than 10% from average levels in recent weeks.  The soybean pit was among the principal targets of the 2 1/2-year inquiry, and 19 soybean traders were indicted, federal officials said yesterday.  Apprehension about the announcement, made by the government at a news conference after the close, made professional traders "a little nervous, and everybody kind of shied away" from taking big positions, one analyst said.  Another analyst cited "a lack of speculative interest, with the approach of Judgment Day."  At the same time, tension about scarce soybean supplies following last year's drought is rapidly easing.  The harvest in South America, where soybean production has risen sharply in recent years in the face of U.S. droughts and production cutbacks, is flowing into world markets.  Prices for Brazilian and Argentina beans have tumbled well below U.S. quotas, said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co., New York.  The record South American supplies are looming just as the healthy U.S. crop matures, said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.  "It's almost as if a second harvest were coming out of South America," he said.  Prices for palm oil, a competing vegetable oil on world markets, are slumping as well.  Few processors and importers are buying soybeans now, preferring to defer their purchases in anticipation of lower prices.  "To keep prices from falling more, we will have to find some demand at this point," said Steve Freed, a senior analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago.  Forecasts of favorable weather added to bearish pressures, said Walter Spilka, analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York.  Soybeans are in the midst of a crucial pod-filling stage, and the weather could hardly be better in many regions of the Farm Belt.  Mr. Spilka says the government is likely to predict a harvest of about 1.85 billion to 1.95 billion bushels of soybeans next week, when it releases a major crop-production report.  That would be an increase of 20% to 27% from last fall's drought-damaged harvest.  Traders noted continued selling in soybeans for August delivery by traders affiliated with Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A.  Earlier this summer, the big Italian merchant and processor was the principal target of the board of trade's emergency liquidation order in soybeans for delivery in July, when the exchange said tight supplies threatened a default.  Some traders feared a repeated showdown in August.  But the supply pressures appear to be easing.  "Overall demand is very slow right now," said Merrill Lynch's Mr. Balletto.  Processors "are being encouraged to keep their purchases at minimal levels.  They probably won't be back into the market in a big way until this fall."  In other commodity markets yesterday:  ENERGY: Last-minute shoppers stepped in to rescue crude-oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange after reports of petroleum inventory buildups had pushed them lower.  The possibility of worsening relations between some Western and Middle Eastern nations also kept prices from dropping too far.  In a final-hour rally, West Texas Intermediate crude gained 25 cents to close at $18.28 a barrel.  Heating oil also closed higher after traders and analysts noted that, even with the inventory buildup, U.S. heating-oil supplies are lower than they were last year at this time.  Gasoline was hit hardest by the bearish statistics in the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report.  The report showed a 4.6 million-barrel jump in gasoline supplies, putting the inventory more than 16 million barrels ahead of a year ago, with refineries churning out still more and the summer driving season two-thirds over.  Even after benefiting from the late rally, September gasoline still closed off 0.58 cent, at 50.85 cents a gallon.  COCOA: Futures prices rose on rumors of a large purchase of cocoa.  The September contract advanced $70 a metric ton, to $1,327.  At one point, it traded as high as $1,342.  Analysts said a major New York trade firm bought between 500,000 and 600,000 metric tons of cocoa from the Ivory Coast.  A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.  The beans are from the crop that will be harvested and sold in the 1989-90 cocoa season that begins Oct. 1.  There was no comment from the firm or Ivory Coast officials on the report.  If the report is true, such a transaction would be likely to create near-term tightness for high-quality cocoa, says Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Prudential Bache Securities, New York.  "But much depends on the sales policy of the company making the purchases," he said.  COPPER: Futures prices advanced for the third consecutive session.  The September contract rose 1.30 cents a pound, to $1.132.  The strike that began July 9 at Highland Valley Mines, a major Canadian copper producer in British Columbia, provided much of the support for the market, according to William O'Neill, vice president, research, for Elders Futures Inc., New York.  There is growing tightness of copper supplies, and if the strike continues much longer, it will exacerbate the situation, he said.  Highland Valley normally produces slightly more than a million pounds of copper daily.  Mediation yesterday entered its second day, but little progress appeared to be made, Mr. O'Neill said, and the mediator talked to union and company representatives separately.  The company has invoked force majeure on two contracts for August delivery, and if the labor dispute isn't settled quickly, it's likely to extend the declaration to September shipments, Mr. O'Neill said.  Force majeure is a contract clause that excuses a supplier if it fails to deliver goods or materials because of factors beyond its control.  As a further indication of shrinking supplies, inventories of copper in warehouses of New York's Commodity Exchange declined 502 tons, to 19,919 tons.  On the other hand, the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, a major copper producer that was under native landowner attack, may soon be back in operation.  The Australian Financial Review said repairs on the mine have begun and that copper production might resume by the end of this month or early September.  The U.S. Mint, meanwhile, plans to hold a tender to buy 10.4 million pounds of copper Aug. 29.  A previous tender July 24 yielded what was regarded as relatively few bids and high prices, an analyst said.  Washington Public Power Supply System, the nuclear power agency responsible for the biggest municipal-bond default in history, is borrowing once again.  The Supply System said it plans to sell $450 million of revenue bonds for its nuclear power plants Nos. 1 and 3.  The bonds, to be priced for sale the week of Aug. 21, are intended to replace high-interest bonds sold in 1981 and 1982.  Those bonds were never in default.  The sale is the first step of the Supply System's plan to refund a total of about $2 billion of similar, high-interest bonds over the next two years.  With the pending sale, the agency returns to the bond market for the first time since defaulting on $2.25 billion of tax-exempt bonds sold in 1983 to finance its nuclear power plants Nos. 4 and 5.  The refunding bonds are secured by net billing agreements that obligate the Bonneville Power Administration to pay all costs of the No. 1 and No. 3 plants, including interest on the bonds.  They have been rated double-A-minus by Standard & Poor's Corp.  At current interest rates, the refunding program will reduce the Supply System's costs an average of $70 million-$80 million a year over the next 30 years, officials of the Supply System and Bonneville Power Administration said.  Defendants in the huge tangle of litigation stemming from the 1983 default reached settlement pacts last year.  The House Agriculture Committee approved legislation that would tighten federal oversight of the nation's futures industry and curb trading abuses.  The bill is designed to toughen federal standards for detecting trading violations in the pits, including those uncovered by the government's huge investigation of the Chicago futures markets.  It would make the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a permanent agency that doesn't require reauthorization every five years, and would boost CFTC funding to $40 million in fiscal 1990 and $44.5 million in fiscal 1991 from its current $34.7 million.  The legislation, adopted on a voice vote yesterday, is expected to clear the House easily after Congress returns from its August recess.  The Senate Agriculture Committee, meanwhile, is on essentially the same track, but moving more slowly.  It is awaiting a General Accounting Office study of the futures markets and plans hearings in September.  Yesterday's vote came after the House agriculture panel debated several amendments, including a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby to require a minimum 15% margin for trading in stock-index futures.  After several committee members denounced the Louisiana Democrat's proposal as a threat to market liquidity, he withdrew it, saying, "We can truly see the effectiveness and power of the lobby of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange."  The key plank in the bipartisan bill would ban dual trading in any futures contract with an average daily volume of 7,000 contracts or more until futures exchanges develop the surveillance capability to detect trading abuses.  The practice of dual trading involves futures brokers' trading for themselves as well as their customers.  An abuse of particular concern to lawmakers is a form of "front-running" in which brokers execute their own trades ahead of customer orders.  The ban would be lifted if an exchange could show that its so-called audit-trail system and other surveillance procedures can catch trading violations.  Exchanges would be required to pinpoint to the minute the time of every trade within one year of the bill's enactment.  The CFTC set a one-minute standard two years ago, but many markets have trouble meeting it, said Rep. Glenn English (D., Okla.), chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the CFTC.  The bill would tighten the standard to 30 seconds within three years of enactment.  "If dual trading is going to take place, {exchanges} are going to have to meet these higher standards," asserted Rep. English.  He described the proposed standards as the toughest "that is technologically or humanly possible."  CFTC officials aren't happy with having a threshold of 7,000 contracts.  The bill would, however, empower them to adjust the threshold in response to price volatility and other market changes.  "This bill is flexible and is certainly something we can live with," said a senior CFTC official.  The legislation also would curb trading among members of "broker associations," and would -- for the first time -- require floor traders who trade only for their own account to register with the CFTC.  In addition, the measure would require exchanges to increase the number of outsiders on their boards and would require periodic training in ethics for futures brokers.  The Senate adopted a $305 billion defense bill that strongly endorses President Bush's proposals for new strategic weapons but rejects parts of his spending plan for conventional arms.  The 95-4 vote approving the fiscal 1990 defense authorization bill puts the Senate squarely behind development of the most expensive weapons sought by the White House, including the B-2 Stealth bomber, a proposed space-based anti-missile shield, and a pair of mobile, land-based nuclear missile systems.  "The basic goals of the president were met," said Virginia Sen. John Warner, the bill's Republican floor manager.  But the Senate's spending blueprint, hammered out during more than a week of frequently emotional debate, differs markedly from the House version of the bill, which sharply cuts spending on the Bush administration's top strategic priorities.  House and Senate conferees are expected to face lengthy and difficult negotiations next month to resolve the disparities.  Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) said there are "more profound differences" between the House and Senate bills this year than at any time in recent memory.  "We'll be interested in hearing {the} logic" behind the House positions, he told reporters after the vote.  "It doesn't leap out at you."  Rushing to dispose of a host of amendments and finish the bill before Congress's scheduled August recess begins at the end of the week, senators yesterday easily rejected efforts to restrict development and testing of anti-satellite weapons.  The administration strongly opposes such restrictions.  But in a series of votes that kept lawmakers on the floor well past midnight Tuesday and into the night yesterday, the Senate approved substantial changes to other parts of the Bush defense package.  Generally, the Senate bill beefs up production of a wide range of conventional weapons that weren't sought by the White House.  The bill, for example, substantially increases funding for various missiles, conventional ammunition, and infantry and anti-tank weapons in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.  And yesterday, without much debate or even a formal vote, senators approved non-binding language supporting continued work on the V-22.  The estimated $25 billion program to produce tilt-rotor transports for the Marine Corps was slated for elimination by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.  The Senate Armed Services Committee previously authorized only research money to continue development of the V-22, built by units of Boeing Co. and Textron Inc.  But the supportive language adopted by the Senate greatly increases the chances that the final version of the bill will follow the House's lead and provide money to begin actual production of the troop transports, which are designed to take off like a helicopter but cruise like a plane.  The Senate bill differs from the House version in several other important ways.  Overall, the House authorized $2.5 billion less than the Senate for the B-2, land-based mobile missiles, and the proposed space-based anti-missile system known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.  The House slashed SDI funding to $3.1 billion from the nearly $4.9 billion requested by the White House, in order to free up money for anti-drug and anti-pollution programs.  The Senate, on the other hand, repeatedly refused to cut SDI funding below the $4.5 billion recommended by the Armed Services Committee.  The Senate measure backs Pentagon plans to deploy a new generation of jet fighters, Army helicopters and Air Force transport planes by the late 1990s.  It authorizes a $2.7 billion down payment on these programs, which are likely to require substantially more than $100 billion if the Pentagon proceeds with full-scale production.  But it deleted funding for continued production of Grumman Corp.'s F-14 jet fighter.  In addition to such big-ticket weapon systems, the Senate's massive authorization bill covers everything from enhanced pay for military pilots and scientists to increased purchases of commercial, "off-the-shelf" items by each of the services.  Other highlights of the Senate bill include:  -- Some $450 million to step up the Pentagon's role in fighting narcotics smuggling.  Overall, the bill earmarks $1.7 billion of unobligated funds from Defense Department accounts and an array of domestic programs to pay for anti-drug legislation that Congress approved last year but still hasn't funded fully.  -- Language urging the Central Intelligence Agency to step up efforts to locate American hostages in the Middle East.  The amendment, among other things, requires the CIA and the Pentagon to report to Congress by Sept. 1, 1990, explaining whether additional money and agents will help find and win the release of the hostages.  Arguing that the CIA relies on a "totally insufficient" cadre of covert operatives in the Middle East, Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), the main sponsor of the amendment, urged the administration "to do whatever it takes" to free the hostages.  -- "Burden-sharing" amendments designed to prod Japan, South Korea and U.S. allies in Western Europe to increase their defense spending.  While the amendments aren't binding and merely express lawmakers' desires to reduce U.S. military spending overseas, they demonstrate growing Senate impatience with some allies.  By a voice vote, senators urged Mr. Bush to consider the "feasibility and desirability of partial, gradual reductions in U.S. military personnel" in South Korea.  The bill also calls for negotiations aimed at getting Japan to pay billions of additional dollars to cover the cost of keeping U.S. forces in that region.  L.A. GEAR Inc., Los Angeles, offered almost 1.2 million common shares for sale at $61.50 each, or a total of $73.8 million.  Of the shares offered, one million were sold by the company and the remaining 162,870 by selling shareholders.  Goldman, Sachs & Co. was lead underwriter for the offering.  L.A. Gear, a designer of fashion and leisure footwear, has about 9.2 million-common shares outstanding following the offering.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the company's shares closed at $61.75, off $1.625.  In the budding business of creating TV programming especially for owners of home-satellite dishes, Viacom International Inc. announced a 24-hour news channel.  The as-yet unnamed channel, a 50-50 joint venture with a unit of Minneapolis-based Hubbard Broadcasting Inc., will offer news, weather, sports, business and feature stories.  The new channel will be freely available to dish owners upon its debut in November, Viacom said, but after an initial preview, the signal will be scrambled and the channel offered for subscription on Jan. 1.  There are currently about 2.5 million U.S. owners of home-satellite dishes, and several programming services -- primarily movie and entertainment channels -- already have been created expressly for this market.  A Viacom spokesman didn't estimate the potential market for the news channel.  The news footage will be supplied by Viacom's partner, the Conus Communications unit of Hubbard.  Conus operates a satellite news network cooperative, pooling local news footage from some 130 TV stations around the country and making the footage available by satellite to other members of the network.  Conus will package the available footage and assemble it into half-hour segments at its Minneapolis facilities.  Borden Inc. said it formed a new joint venture with Toagosei Chemical Industry Co., Tokyo, the maker of Krazy Glue, to distribute the adhesives in North America, Central America and most of South America.  The rights were purchased for more than $10 million from B. Jadow & Sons, New York, which has marketed Krazy Glue in the U.S. since 1973.  Borden said sales of Krazy Glue adhesives, together with its Elmer's brand of glues, would have annual retail sales in excess of $150 million.  The venture is subject to federal approvals, and is expected to close in early September.  It is Borden's fourth joint venture with a Japanese company and the first in the U.S.  Borden, based in New York, produces foods, non-food consumer products, packaging and industrial products; its sales are expected to reach $8 billion this year.  USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry said he expects second-half sales to be lower than the $9.42 billion posted in the first six months of 1989.  He attributed the decline in part to softness in several areas, including the automotive and construction markets, as well as continued weak demand for steel goods serving the pipeline industry.  He declined to speculate on earnings.  Separately, Mr. Corry said USX hasn't received a reasonable offer for any or part of its steel operations.  In the past, the nation's largest steelmaker has indicated its willingness to sell 20% of its steel operations.  Mr. Corry said the company has been approached from time to time with "ideas, none sufficiently attractive enough to be acted upon."  Moreover, Mr. Corry added that at this point the steel operations are providing a satisfactory return on investments.  Investor Carl Icahn, who holds a major stake in USX, has urged that the company spin off its steel operations.  In yesterday's composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USX shares closed at $35.375, up 37.5 cents.  The House voted to permanently extend the current smoking ban on commercial airline flights of two hours or less.  The 259-169 roll call came on a larger procedural resolution, but the impact was to automatically attach the ban to a nearly $12 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill pending in the chamber.  The size of the vote was interpreted as a strong endorsement of the current restriction due to expire next April, and proponents said they were confident the ban would become permanent law.  Tobacco interests appeared resigned to the same conclusion and, though their support is stronger in the Senate, the industry has fallen back to a position of fighting any expansion of the ban to flights longer than two hours.  Yesterday's vote was clouded by unrelated procedural issues, but the size of the margin is far larger than the narrow five-vote victory two years ago when the current restrictions were first adopted by the House.  Turner Broadcasting System Inc., as expected, reported for the second quarter its first profit in more than three years.  The Atlanta cable-television programmer said it earned $5.5 million, compared with a loss of $25.9 million a year ago.  The profit reflected a special tax credit of $8.7 million in the period.  Revenue jumped 33% to $264.5 million from $199.3 million.  In the six months, profit was $5.1 million, compared with a loss of $40 million a year ago.  Revenue increased 30% to $496.5 million from $381.9 million.  Turner didn't report per-share profit because its net income didn't cover preferred stock requirements in the periods.  Chairman Ted Turner said the company's operating profit is expected to improve throughout the rest of the year, but "we continue to expect a net loss for the full year of 1989."  Turner shares closed yesterday at $57, up 87.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.  De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc. filed suit against its ousted chairman, Dino De Laurentiis, charging he made a series of fraudulent business deals with the company.  The suit seeks more than $50 million in damages.  Separately, De Laurentiis Entertainment said Carolco Pictures Inc. revised its earlier bid to buy the failed movie studio, boosting the offer by $10 million to about $34 million in cash and stock.  De Laurentiis Entertainment has been operating under Chapter 11 of federal bankuptcy law since August of last year.  The suit, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, charges that while Mr. De Laurentiis was chairman of De Laurentiis, companies he controlled sold movie rights to the studio after overstating their worth.  Mr. De Laurentiis was forced out as chairman and chief executive officer in February 1988 after a string of devastating losses.  Mr. De Laurentiis couldn't be reached for comment on the suit.  The flamboyant producer controls about 61% of the company's stock.  Robert Goldsmith, general counsel of De Laurentiis, said that under the current reorganization plan, it is unlikely shareholders will receive any compensation for their shares.  The plan hasn't yet been approved by a bankruptcy court.  The company said the suit seeks damages for alleged violations of federal racketeering laws and indemnity for any loss the company suffers as a result of certain class-action suits against it.  In March of last year, shareholders sued the company and Mr. De Laurentiis, alleging securites law violations related to the company's May 1986 initial public offering.  The status of that suit couldn't be learned late yesterday.  Mr. De Laurentiis, an Italian movie producer, founded the company with the goal of building a major motion-picture studio nearly overnight.  The company raised $85 million in a June 1986 public offering and an affiliate raised an additional $22 million.  But most of the company's pictures were unsuccessful and it had large losses.  These days Mr. De Laurentiis works as an independent producer, and he leases an office in the building still occupied by the studio.  Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who purchased Pathe Communications Corp., formerly Cannon Group Inc., bought the office building earlier this year through a company he controls.  A lawyer for Pathe said he isn't certain whether the building was purchased from Mr. De Laurentiis or a company Mr. De Laurentiis controls.  Earlier this year Mr. Parretti said Pathe Communications had made a bid to acquire De Laurentiis for $22 million but ended the talks.  Then in April, Carolco said it expected to sign a definitive agreement to acquire De Laurentiis for about $25 million.  Yesterday, De Laurentiis said the terms of the Carolco agreement were revised to increase the cash portion of the offer to $28 million from $18.5 million.  That is in addition to a 50.1% stake in the reorganized company with a guaranteed value of at least $6 million.  Officials at Carolco didn't return phone calls.  Carolco is a movie company best known for its action films, such as "Red Heat" and the "Rambo" series.  As Merrill Lynch envisioned things, Tracor, an Austin, Texas, defense company, was to have the brightest of futures.  Led by retired Navy Adm. Bobby R. Inman, Tracor would show steady increases in sales, earnings and profit margins, Merrill predicted.  With Mr. Inman -- former head of the National Security Agency -- at the helm and a host of other luminaries on the board, Tracor would make strategic acquisitions and convert its contacts at the Pentagon into rich government contracts.  Today, a scant 12 months later, the market value of $400 million in Tracor junk bonds sold by Merrill has fallen by 35%, while untroubled junk issues have been more or less flat.  Tracor's recent sales, operating profits and margins are down.  And Merrill is preparing to sell Tracor assets to keep the company ahead of its crushing debt burden.  The jury is out on whether, in the long term, asset sales will rescue the company or make bondholders whole.  But Mr. Inman has learned some things his bankers -- at Shearson Lehman Hutton as well as at Merrill -- didn't tell him.  "The conclusion I have come to is that you shouldn't leverage in the defense business.  There wasn't any track record" that could meaningfully predict the future, he says.  With the U.S. government as its prime customer, Tracor was helpless when defense spending slowed.  Internally, Mr. Inman says he discovered that expenses couldn't be cut as easily as bankers had forecast.  And fees were higher than expected.  Mr. Inman calls it all "part of my education."  "Tracor is an example of excess," says a bond investor who bailed out early.  Tracor's bankers, the investor says, "decided how much to pay, and they paid too much."  Tracor's investment bankers declined to comment.  But if Tracor is judged against prices paid for other leveraged buy-outs, Mr. Inman points out, it's less an example of excess than of following the leader.  Tracor was acquired for $714 million -- 23 times its earnings -- in a 1987 LBO, with the help of a $330 million bridge loan from Shearson.  The buyer was Westmark Systems, a holding company set up and controlled by Dallas merchant banker Mason Best.  Mason Best recruited former cabinet secretarys Donald Rumsfeld (Defense) and Drew Lewis (Transportation), and ex-National Democratic Committee chief Robert S. Strauss, for Westmark's board.  But a month after the Tracor LBO, the stock market crashed.  Shearson suddenly decided the capitalization looked iffy; it wanted more equity invested.  Shearson was also worried about a Pentagon probe of Tracor's pricing well before the Inman era.  Mason Best then went to Merrill, which bought out Shearson's bridge loan.  Two investment bankers were costlier than one.  Shearson "got out with all their fees," Mr. Inman says.  Total fees and expenses for all the bankers and lawyers ran to $70 million -- 10% of the purchase price.  And as bankers ran into delays, interest rates rose.  Merrill sold Tracor's paper a year after the LBO. Buyers scooped up $230 million in 14% senior subordinated notes and $170 million in zero-coupon debentures, which pay 16% starting 1994.  Merrill's forecast for Tracor, drawn on a bar chart, may be described as a straight line rising steadily and without pause.  For instance, sales were to grow 15% in 1989 and at double-digit rates thereafter.  But for Tracor, the easing of U.S.-Soviet tensions is bad news.  Sales in the 1989 first quarter were 2% less than in 1988.  For the year, earnings estimates have been lowered by 15%.  The Pentagon has gotten tightfisted in paying for cost overruns.  And Tracor has suffered from production problems and delays.  Mr. Inman is moving to correct the situation.  But he says Tracor still has to buy materials in advance and hold its breath until Uncle Sam orders work. (Tracor says it doesn't think the Pentagon probe of its pricing will materially affect it.)  Besides defense, Tracor has operations in high-tech instruments and electronic fuses.  They are performing better than defense, but they are relatively small.  "They are permitting us to service the debt, but down the line we can't carry such significant leverage," Mr. Inman says.  Although Westmark invested $175 million of cash in Tracor, losses have watered down Tracor's equity to 5% of its capital.  Bank and other debt totals $777 million.  In the first quarter, free cash flow was 57% of the total needed to service cash debt (not including interest on zero-coupon bonds).  Tracor has been drawing on its working capital, but Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Maeda Klein says that, without selling assets, Tracor could fall far short of its $30 million in bank payments due next year.  Ms. Klein, though, is a bull on Tracor's senior notes, selling a bit above 60 cents on the dollar.  She says the company's assets, if sold, should fully protect bondholders.  Mr. Inman agrees, though he says it will be tough and lengthy going.  Before the 1980s debt revolution, growth companies such as Tracor were likely to be funded with patient venture capital.  But debt, Mr. Inman notes, isn't patient.  Thus, he plans on selling "whatever assets bring the best price."  Next year, he fears, a recession could cripple values.  He is moving to sell assets now, before bankers are at his door.  Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong, said it forged a marketing alliance with American Airlines under which it will use Los Angeles as a gateway to link up with some of American's flights.  Cathay said it will begin the colony's first nonstop service to Los Angeles in July 1990 and offer connecting service to San Francisco on an American Airlines plane that will carry a Cathay flight number.  A Cathay spokesman said negotiations are under way to expand the pact to include connecting flights to other U.S. cities.  He said the talks won't include the subject of the carriers swapping equity stakes.  Under the plan, Cathay will break off its existing daily Hong Kong-Vancouver-San Francisco service in Canada.  It will start four weekly Hong Kong-Los Angeles flights with connecting service to San Francisco, and expand to daily service in 1991.  For American Airlines, the move gives the carrier another link in the Pacific, a market with tremendous growth but where it has only one route, Dallas/Fort Worth-Tokyo.  "We're trying to extend our presence in the Pacific in any way that makes sense for us," said an American spokesman.  "This is another way for us to do it in the short term, until we can get our service extended."  Eastern Airlines pilots won a round in bankruptcy court that they say could bring them as much as $250 million in back pay, but an arbitrator must decide how much -- if anything -- they are owed.  The decision by Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York will allow the Air Line Pilots Association to go forward with a claim that a "pay parity" clause in their contract was triggered when another Eastern union received a pay raise.  All legal proceedings against Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., were put on hold when Eastern filed for bankruptcy-law protection March 9.  But Judge Lifland lifted that stay to let the three-year-old back-pay claim go to arbitration, provided that process is swift.  If it doesn't go quickly enough, the judge said he may invoke a provision of the bankruptcy code that would let him estimate what pilots are owed.  The arbitration is scheduled to begin Aug. 9.  At issue is a three-year-old effort by the pilots to prove they had a valid contract in 1986, and that Eastern violated a clause in it that would give them raises if any other group got raises.  Shortly after Texas Air took over Eastern, management supervisors for the machinists' union received a 20% pay raise.  The pilots have won two rounds of this battle in federal court, with federal district court and an appeals court deciding that the pilots' contract was valid.  Neither court, however, ruled on the merits of their claim.  Recognition Equipment Inc., a Dallas-based maker of data management equipment, said it acquired Plexus Computer Inc.'s image processing software technology, which will be used to establish a new subsidiary.  Terms weren't disclosed.  Recognition said the purchase involves most of the remaining assets of Plexus, a San Jose, Calif.-based computer and software concern that had protection from creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since mid-March.  Officials of Recognition said that as a result of its purchase, the Plexus bankruptcy-law case was closed.  Recognition said it plans to operate its acquisition as a subsidiary named Plexus Software Inc., with principal offices to be in Santa Clara, Calif.  Atlantic Richfield Co., Los Angeles, said Siemens AG of West Germany signed a letter of intent to acquire Arco's solar panel business.  The anticipated sale price wasn't disclosed, but analysts put it at between $30 million and $50 million.  Arco Solar, which makes photovoltaic products that convert sunlight into electricity, is the leader in the fledgling $100 million solar-cell industry.  The unit contributed about $30 million in revenue last year.  Arco will continue to operate its two large solar power plants in California, which weren't included in the proposed sale, expected to be completed this fall.  Though photovoltaics were never profitable for Arco, a spokesman said the company invested more than $200 million in the technology since 1977.  Arco's main reason for leaving the alternative energy field, however, is to concentrate on its core oil, gas, coal and chemicals businesses.  Arco Solar will become part of Siemen's U.S. group of companies, which had $3.1 billion in revenue last year from a range of businesses including power generation and transmission.  It will be operated in conjunction with Siemens's solar company.  Toys "R" Us Inc. said second-quarter sales rose 13% to $775.7 million from $686.8 million a year ago.  But sales at stores open for longer than a year were basically flat.  The Paramus, N.J., toy retailer said sales at its older stores only edged up in part because it was difficult to top last year's gain of 17% in those stores at a time when the industry as a whole wasn't growing greatly.  Analysts said last year many more new toys were introduced earlier in the year, enticing many buyers to visit toy stores.  Spring and early summer are generally slower periods in toy sales, noted Donald Trott, retail toy analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds.  "But last year a number of financially troubled toy manufacturers began promoting some of their products on television and in ads beginning in the spring and others did likewise," he said.  Toys "R" Us added overseas sales in its toy stores and Kids "R" Us children clothing division were strong.  The Senate Labor Committee, amid partisan arguments on whether its effort should be bipartisan, approved legislation that would authorize a national community-service program with paid volunteers.  The measure passed 11-4, with four of the committee's Republicans voting against it.  The bill, authored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D., Md.), would provide as much as $330 million to create a youth conservation corps and to recruit community volunteers to perform such tasks as leading aerobics at nursing homes, delivering meals to shut-ins or teaching reading.  The bill also would finance other, existing volunteer programs.  Volunteers would get health insurance and a stipend of as much as $7,000 a year.  At the end of their service, volunteers also could receive as much as $8,500 for each year served.  Sen. Thad Cochran (R., Miss.) voted for the bill but protested that the Democratic majority is pushing it too soon.  He said the committee should wait for a commission named by President Bush to recommend what a national service should do, so that a bipartisan bill could be fashioned.  Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) objected to paying volunteers, especially considering federal-budget constraints.  SFFed Corp. said it will post a loss for the third quarter after taking a one-time after-tax charge of $18 million on the sale of $965 million in assets.  It didn't estimate the loss and company officials couldn't be reached for comment.  The assets are primarily fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities and long-term, low-yielding bonds.  A year earlier, SFFed had earnings of $4.3 million, or 55 cents a share.  The San Francisco thrift holding company said it will use the money from the sale to repay a "like amount of non-deposit liabilities."  The combined moves are expected to "improve core earnings" and "increase the ratio of capital to assets," SFFed said.  Following the sale, SFFed, the holding company for San Francisco Federal Savings & Loan Association, said it will have assets of about $3.46 billion.  Unitrode Corp., a Lexington, Mass., maker of semiconductor products, said it agreed in principle to sell its San Diego-based Passive Components division to AVX Corp., a New York-based maker of passive electronic products.  Walter B. Gates, Unitrode senior vice president, said the sale price will range from $13 million to $15 million, depending on the net asset value of the assets being acquired on the transaction's closing date.  Passive Components makes capacitors and filters used to protect electronics.  Unitrode will have a "modest gain" from the sale, which is expected to be completed during Unitrode's third quarter ending Oct. 28.  In the year-earlier quarter, Unitrode earned $362,651, or three cents a share, on sales of $40.9 million.  Unitrode said the unit had a "small profit" in the year ended Jan. 31 on sales of about $22 million, which accounted for about 14% of Unitrode's total sales of $163.3 million.  Completion of the sale is subject to a definitive pact and other conditions.  Corporations continued to issue large amounts of new debt yesterday, even though the bond market rally lost momentum.  In the past two days, more than a dozen companies have entered the market with $2.6 billion of debt offerings.  Some of the issues, including McDonald's Corp. and Export Development Corp., were said to have sold briskly.  But a few other issues encountered investor resistance as the rally faded.  "This market is not a bottomless pit," one syndicate official said.  "The supply will be digested in the next couple of days, but until some of this paper clears or the markets rally, the window is basically closed for others," he added.  Corporate bond traders said the issues sold "reasonably well," but added that about $1 billion, or 38%, of the new debt hasn't yet been sold and remains in underwriters' inventories.  One company too late to tap the market was United Technologies Corp.  The huge volume of new issues and the sluggish tone of the secondary market forced the defense contractor to call off a $140 million issue of 30-year debentures, according to traders.  In trading yesterday, prices of actively traded corporate bonds were unchanged to 1/4 point lower, or down as much as $2.50 per $1,000 face amount.  In the Treasury market, prices were unchanged to modestly lower in sporadic trading as investors moved cautiously ahead of Friday's employment report for July and the government's announcement of the details of its next quarterly refunding.  The benchmark 30-year bond, which rose nearly 1/2 point during the day, closed slightly lower than Tuesday.  Shorter-term issues were as much as 1/8 point lower.  The Treasury said it plans to sell $29.5 billion of notes and bonds to raise about $13.6 billion in cash.  The Treasury will redeem $15.9 billion of maturing government securities.  But the Treasury said the auction will take place only if Congress increases the federal government's current debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion.  That contingency clause will limit the amount of preliminary trading activity, which bond dealers refer to as "when-issued" trading.  During that period, dealers are able to size up the market and estimate the level of investor demand for the new bonds.  As a result of the contingency clause, some analysts speculate that yields on the new bonds could come in slightly higher to compensate dealers for the greater risk involved with participating in the auction.  Maria Fiorini Ramirez, money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said that "a shorter distribution process before the auction does not help the Treasury in financing its obligations," cheaply.  But she added, "I never remember Congress being cost-conscious on this matter."  Joseph Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co., believes that Congress will pass the proposed debt ceiling increase over the weekend, which will allow when-issued activity to begin Monday.  Mr. Liro said that prices at the auction might depend upon tomorrow's employment report.  "If the report is weaker than expected, the auction prices will come in higher.  Conversely, if the report is stronger than expected, yields will back up."  Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets expect, on average, a 158,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in July.  In June, non-farm payrolls grew by 180,000.  The economists' average estimate for the July unemployment rate is 5.3%, unchanged from June.  Treasury Securities  Treasury securities ended unchanged to slightly lower in light trading.  The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at about 111 25/32 to yield about 7.84%, down from a price of 111 29/32 and yield of 7.83% Tuesday.  The latest 10-year notes were quoted unchanged at 109 7/32 to yield 7.75%.  Some five-year notes fell as much as 1/4 point.  Short-term rates were mixed.  The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.66% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.9% compared with a rate of 7.69% and yield of 7.93% Tuesday.  But the rate on six-month Treasury bills rose to 7.42% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.79% compared with a rate of 7.36% and yield of 7.73% Tuesday.  Municipal Issues Washington Public Power Supply System, the nuclear power agency behind the biggest municipal bond default in history, plans to issue new debt later this month.  WPPSS said it intends to offer $450 million of revenue bonds for two of its nuclear power plants.  Goldman Sachs & Co. will be lead underwriter for the negotiated financing, WPPSS's first sale since it defaulted five years ago on $2.25 billion of bonds.  The memory of the default notwithstanding, officials connected with the sale don't expect investors to demand a significant yield premium from the new debt.  "We don't feel there should be a premium.  This is going to be one of the best-funded issues that you're ever going to see," says Carl Halvorson, chairman of the WPPSS executive board.  "This should be regarded as an absolutely prime credit compared to all revenue bonds."  Rather than being secured by a revenue stream from underlying WPPSS projects, Mr. Halvorson says the refunding bonds will be backed by net billing agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration.  Today, New York City takes bids for $950 million revenue anticipation notes and $300 million tax anticipation notes, all due June 29, 1990.  Corporate Issues  The onslaught of new corporate bond offerings continued with five companies issuing a total of $750 million of new debt.  Among the best-received offerings yesterday was McDonald's $100 million of 30-year debentures and Export Development's $200 million of 10-year notes.  McDonald's debentures were priced to yield 9.001% while Export Development's notes were priced to yield 8.181%.  Sears Roebuck & Co. came to market with $200 million of seven-year notes priced at a yield 8.55%.  According to a Sears spokesperson, proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including retiring some commercial paper debt.  In other new-issue market news, Standard & Poor's Corp. assigned an E-3 event-risk covenant ranking to Bowater Inc.'s issue of $300 million of 20-year debentures, which were priced to yield 9% on Tuesday by First Boston Corp.  This is the first new corporate bond offering to be evaluted under S&P's new bondholder protection ranking service.  Prior to this, the rating agency had announced event-risk covenant rankings to existing corporate bond issues.  According to the credit rating agency, the ranking indicates that "covenants in the issue provide some event-risk protection by allowing debt holders to put the bonds back to Bowater should certain credit-damaging events occur."  S&P's event-risk covenant rankings, which were started last month, have five categories.  E-3 stands midway.  Traders have said the Bowater bonds was the best-received deal in the past two sessions because of strong investor demand for event-risk protection.  Mortgage-Backed Issues  Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities ended as much as 3/8 point lower, amid continued pressure by thrift selling.  "It's hard to tell whether all the (portfolio) liquidations you hear about are true, but the threat is still there," says one trader of the thrift selling that has kept mortgage securities under a cloud.  There was speculation early yesterday that one ailing thrift had sold over $1 billion of mortgage securities late Tuesday and early yesterday.  Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for August delivery was quoted at 99 11/32, down 7/32 on the day, after wavering in a 99 3/32 to 99 19/32 range.  The closely watched coupon was yielding about 9.21% to a 12-year average life assumption.  Ginnie Mae's 8 1/2% issue was quoted at 97 1/4, down 6/32, while its 9 1/2% securities were off 7/32 at 101 3/32.  In the derivative arena, Prudential-Bache Capital Funding launched a $420 million issue of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Remic mortgage securities in nine classes, six of which are planned amortization classes.  A Remic is a real estate mortgage investment conduit.  The offering, Series 80, is backed by Freddie Mac's 9% issue, with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 25.67 years.  Foreign Bonds  Most foreign bond markets were quiet, but a large offering of dollar-denominated Eurobonds sparked some interest.  West Germany's BASF Finance Europe NV, a unit of BASF AG, issued $300 million of 8% seven-year Eurobonds.  Traders said German corporations seldom tap the Euromarket, which lends their debt a certain rarity value.  "It's the sort of paper that German institutions just have to buy," one dealer said.  Elsewhere:  -- Japanese government bonds were little changed in quiet trading.  The benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 closed at a price of 97.42, down 0.03 yen per 100 yen face value.  The issue's yield was 5.02%.  -- West German government bonds were unchanged to slightly lower.  Bonn's 7% issue due February 1999 ended at 102.80 to yield 6.59%, the same as Tuesday.  The 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell 0.05 point to 100.475 to yield 6.62%.  -- British government bonds drifted lower.  The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 ended 5/32 lower at 115 18/32 to yield 9.65%.  The 11 3/4% notes due 1991 fell 1/32 at 99 29/32 to yield 11.75%.  Minnesota Power & Light Co., Duluth, said it agreed to sell a 20% stake in its Clay Boswell Unit 4 coal-fired plant to Wisconsin Public Power Inc. System.  Terms weren't disclosed.  The utility said that under the pact the transaction must be completed by Oct. 31, 1990, and is subject to board approval by both companies, regulatory approval and definitive agreements.  The agreement is also contingent upon arrangements to transmit electric power through Northern States Power Co., Minneapolis, and other Wisconsin utilities to Wisconsin Public Power members.  Wisconsin Public Power, based in Sun Prairie, Wis., provides bulk electric power to 29 municipal electric systems that serve about 85,000 customers in Wisconsin.  Minnesota Power said it has the right to terminate the proposed sale depending on the outcome of litigation between it and Northern States related to the previously negotiated $180 million sale of a 40% stake in the plant to Northern States in October 1986.  Northern States has refused to proceed with the transaction without certain assurances from regulators and has filed suit to terminate the previous transaction, the company said.  A new report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development inspector general indicates that profiteering in programs meant for low -- and moderate -- income residents by well-connected consultants is more widespread than previously reported.  Twenty different consultants were paid more than $5.7 million to help channel 51 Section 8 moderate-rehabilitation projects to developers, according to the latest figures released by Inspector General Paul Adams.  His earlier report, released in April, listed 12 consultants who got $4.2 million for work on 27 projects.  Meanwhile, a house panel voted yesterday to subpoena Lance Wilson, the executive assistant to former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce.  Mr. Wilson failed to appear for scheduled testimony before the employment and housing subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee last month.  Mr. Wilson must appear before the panel on Sept. 27 or risk being held in contempt of Congress.  Revelations about abuses in the low-income rent-subsidy program surfaced in the April report and that, along with allegations of widespread influence-peddling, favoritism and embezzlement led to congressional and agency investigations into all HUD programs.  The moderate-rehabilitation program, which began in 1979, was temporarily suspended by current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp following that April report.  In yesterday's report to the Senate committee, Mr. Adams provided additional details about the lucrative role of politically well-connected consultants in the moderate-rehabilitation program and the double subsidies many projects received through use of a low-income housing tax credit.  The role of the consultant was greatly enhanced when Congress, at the request of the Reagan administration, waived the fair-share housing formula that distributed funds based on need, according to census, housing survey and economic data calculations.  The fair-share distribution formula ended in late 1983.  Mr. Adams's testimony indicates that certain projects would probably not have been awarded if the fair-share procedure had been followed.  "As a matter of fact, 45 of the 51 projects where developers paid consultants fall in states" receiving disproportionately high shares of moderate rehabilitation program money, according to Mr. Adams.  His latest report shows several consultants received more in fees for their work on the moderate-rehabilitation program than was indicated in the April report.  Mr. Adams said, however, that three consulting firms will receive less than previously reported because "five developers informed us that because of all the recent media attention some billings were not paid in full."  For example, Frederick Bush, ambassador-designee to Luxembourg and chief fund-raiser in President Bush's presidential campaign (they are not related) will be paid $215,000 instead of $260,000.  The report also states that separate firms led by former HUD officials Joseph Strauss and Philip Abrams received $1,684,875 and $100,000 respectively.  Also, Mr. Adams said that Louie Nunn, former governor of Kentucky, received $594,000; Carla Hills, U.S. trade representative and former HUD secretary, received $138,000; and Paul Manafort, political lobbyist, received $348,500.  Sen. Paul Sarbanes, (D., Md.) said the high consulting fees "deprived people who need housing the opportunity to get housing."  If consultants and developers hadn't been "raking off" HUD funds, he complained, "we would have had more money to build more units."  The inspector general said that ownership interest by former HUD officials in moderate-rehabilitation developments was "another key point that led us to conclude that favoritism played an important part in project selection."  "It should be noted that in the 23 projects concentrated in Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada," Mr. Adams said, "one or more former HUD officials were involved in every project as an owner, consultant or mortgage broker."  Testimony before the committee also indicated how the Federal Housing Administration's co-insurance program for low -- and moderate -- income multifamily dwellings and low-income housing tax credits significantly boost per-unit subsidies.  For example, Mr. Adams said that a housing development backed by Benton Mortgage Co. in Knoxville, Tenn., set rents, which were federally subsidized, "at artificially high levels in relation to actual rent levels in the project locations."  After the Senate hearing, Chris Greer, assistant attorney general for audit, said Thomas Demery, a former assistant HUD secretary, granted waivers allowing the higher rents for Benton-backed projects, against the advice of local HUD and housing authority officials.  John Ols, director of housing and community development issues for the General Accounting Office, told the committee that syndication of tax credits, in combination with other funding sources, allows developers to reap "cash proceeds that greatly exceeded costs associated with acquiring and rehabilitating the properties."  The report said the GAO surveyed eight projects that received "substantial" proceeds from the sale of tax credits.  Three of the projects were developed by the Winn Group, which was formed by Philip Winn, U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and Mr. Abrams, former deputy assistant secretary for housing and, later, undersecretary.  Mr. Winn was an assistant secretary for housing during President Reagan's first term.  FORTY-SIX TRADERS have been charged in the Chicago futures probe, the first indictments in the scandal.  The felony charges claim commodities traders used a variety of illegal practices to divide profitable trades among themselves and stick outsiders with losses.  Several of those accused already have agreed to cooperate with federal investigators, and over 100 may eventually be indicted.  ---  Falconbridge of Toronto agreed to be acquired by Amax in a transaction valued at $2.42 billion.  The takeover will make Amax one of the world's biggest base-metal producers.  ---  Avon Products will consider today a $41 a share, or $2.85 billion, takeover offer from Irwin Jacobs.  The investor is renewing his pursuit of the cosmetics giant after a joint bid with Amway collapsed in May.  ---  House tax writers are likely to postpone any action on cutting the capital-gains tax at least until September.  The Ways and Means panel remains divided over the issue.  ---  Home Shopping Network's lawsuit against GTE backfired when a jury ordered the TV retailer and two officers to pay the telephone company $100 million for defamation.  ---  Taiwan investor Fred Lee agreed to pay $25.15 million to settle a civil insider-trading suit, the third-largest in SEC history.  But the accord left an important issue largely unresolved.  ---  Factory orders rose 0.4% in June, led by a surge in military items.  Analysts said the report indicated continued weakness in the industrial sector though not a recession.  ---  Rates on fixed mortgages are approaching two-year lows of 9.25% to 9.5%, with further declines expected.  The recent drop in rates has sparked modest increases in house sales.  ---  Texaco and Exxon were ordered to pay over $2 billion in back taxes and interest for oil bought at below-market prices as long as a decade ago.  Both plan to fight the claim.  ---  The Senate passed an $885 million disaster-relief package to help farmers who've had significant crop losses to drought and flooding this year.  ---  The Princeton/Newport jury decided that the six defendants must forfeit $3.8 million in assets, far less than the government sought.  But the judge may increase the amount.  ---  Integrated Resources turned over the chairman's post to Stephen Weinroth, a top officer of the company's investment bank, Drexel.  ---  RJR Nabisco posted a 24% jump in operating profit from its core businesses for the second quarter.  The company had a net loss of $309 million due to interest and debt expenses.  ---  Siemens and GEC are expected to revive their long-stalled bid for Plessey after clearing the last regulatory hurdle in Britain for the takeover.  ---  Stocks and the dollar rose and bonds fell as investors awaited tomorrow's report on July employment.  ---  Markets --  Stocks: Volume 181,760,000 shares.  Dow Jones industrials 2657.44, up 16.32; transportation 1273.47, off 5.51; utilities 219.19, off 1.26.  Bonds: Shearson Lehman Hutton Treasury index 3400.61, up 1.77.  Commodities: Dow Jones futures index 128.70, up 0.23; spot index 128.64, up 0.06.  Dollar: 136.65 yen, up 0.75; 1.8588 marks, up 0.0078.  The Senate passed an $885 million disaster-relief package to help thousands of farmers who have suffered significant crop losses to drought and flooding this year.  The legislation would cover more than 50 crops, rather than just the major crops in the government's farm-subsidy program, and would compensate eligible farmers at a rate equal to 65% of their anticipated prices.  Nevertheless, it is considerably less generous than the $1.3 billion disaster bill adopted by the House last month.  The Senate shaved about $55 million off the initial package in voting yesterday to embrace a legislative compromise thrashed out by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), the ranking minority member.  On the floor, Sen. Leahy called the bill "equitable" and "fiscally sound" and said that it would meet the budget cap that the Bush administration put on disaster relief in fiscal 1990, starting Oct. 1.  He called for an immediate conference with House farm leaders to reconcile the differences between the Senate and House packages.  "We must keep this bill within budget limits," he said.  He also expressed hope that the legislation could clear both houses before Congress goes into its August recess.  Both bills would set a $100,000 ceiling on disaster payments to individual farmers.  The House would compensate farmers at two rates -- 65% if farmers lost 35% to 75% of their crops and 90% if they lost more than 75%.  Under the compromise package, the cost-conscious Senate found savings by adopting a single 65% rate and specifying that farmers raising so-called program crops must suffer a 40% crop loss to qualify for relief.  The eligibility standard for soybean and sunflower growers would be a 45% crop loss, and it would be 50% for producers of fruits, vegetables and other nonprogram crops.  Critics contend that ad hoc disaster relief undercuts efforts to expand the federal crop insurance program.  Only 50% of the eligible cropland in the U.S. was insured this year.  Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and several lawmakers maintain that the nation will have to choose between ad hoc disaster relief and crop insurance.  In a nod toward critics, the Senate rewarded farmers who had bought federal crop insurance by setting the eligibility level at a 35% loss.  The chairman of a special directors' committee at Occidental Petroleum Corp. that approved spending $86 million on an art museum for Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Armand Hammer's collection appears to have understood little about the project the committee approved.  According to court papers filed by the plaintiff in a shareholder suit, former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., among other things, misunderstood who would own the future museum, wasn't able to outline the tax consequences of the project, and wasn't aware of the approximate value of the collection the museum would contain.  The court papers, previously under seal in Delaware's Chancery Court, were made public at the request of this newspaper and the Los Angeles Times.  They are part of a record compiled in litigation contesting the right of Los Angeles-based Occidental to build the museum and provide for its future operating costs.  Mr. Gore, who retired from the Senate in 1973 and who has been a director of Occidental since 1972, chaired an eight-member committee of outside directors that approved the project in February.  The 81-year-old former Tennessee senator testified under oath in a deposition that is part of a procedural offshoot of the case, in which plaintiff Alan R. Kahn is opposing a proposed settlement by another plaintiff.  According to sections of the deposition quoted in a plaintiff's memorandum, Sen. Gore testified that the museum complex and related parking facilities were being given to the museum by Occidental.  He later modified that testimony to exclude the parking facility from the gift.  However, the complicated plans actually call for Occidental to own all of the complex for 30 years, leasing it rent-free to the museum.  Eventually, the museum is to buy the site -- nearly a block in the posh Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles that surrounds Occidental's headquarters -- for $55 million, which is the same value currently put on the property.  The museum will pay for the site with the proceeds of a $36 million annuity being given to it by Occidental this year.  Court filings by Occidental and its directors assert that sections of Sen. Gore's deposition cited in the plaintiff's filings are selective and misleading.  However, they don't specifically refute the senator's apparent confusion about the ownership of the museum.  Occidental's lawyers said an example of truncated testimony is a section in which Sen. Gore says he failed to ask questions at a key meeting about certain tax savings.  But the quote, Occidental's brief says, excludes Sen. Gore's point that someone else on the committee did ask about tax issues.  This newspaper and the Los Angeles Times have sought access to the full testimony by Sen. Gore and others; however, lawyers for the directors are considering whether they will oppose lifting the seal that they requested be placed on the remainder of the information.  But time and again it appears in sections of testimony quoted by the plaintiff's filing that the former senator -- selected to head the committee, according to Occidental, because he was its senior member -- had only a limited grasp of the complicated museum plan.  Despite questions by other members of the committee, Sen. Gore concluded in testimony that he didn't know whether Occidental would get a tax deduction as a result of any donation it might make to the museum.  Also, the senator said he didn't know the approximate value of the works to be displayed in the museum.  Occidental has said the collection is valued at $300 million to $400 million -- a point it emphasizes routinely in supporting plans for the museum.  Nor did Sen. Gore know whether Dr. Hammer would personally donate any money to the museum that is to bear his name. (Important pieces in the art collection were purchased by the Armand Hammer Foundation, which receives major donations from Occidental.)  Other parts of the plaintiff's filing say that an analysis by a Philadelphia law firm of the project's cost to Occidental could total $160 million, rather than the $86 million disclosed by the company.  Occidental said the difference between the two numbers is attributable to the cost of the annuity purchase compared with the much larger total paid out by it over time.  Also included in the filing are portions of testimony by William Prickett, a lawyer representing shareholders Joseph Sullivan and Alan I. Brody, who reached a proposed settlement with Occidental.  In the testimony presented, Mr. Prickett said he hadn't reviewed documents or taken depositions in the case prior to starting settlement talks.  Part of the settlement includes $1.5 million in legal fees payable to Mr. Prickett and other lawyers representing Messrs.  Sullivan and Brody.  In its filing, Occidental said the settlement talks with Mr. Prickett were protracted and that Mr. Prickett extracted concessions from Occidental.  The June 3 proposed settlement limited future donations that Occidental could make to charities associated with Dr. Hammer (including the museum).  The pact, among other things, limited to $60 million the construction outlays for the museum, which are estimated at $50 million.  When the proposed settlement became known, Mr. Kahn, who as trustee for an estate holding Occidental stock, has been a plaintiff in a case filed before Messrs.  Sullivan and Brody's, objected and sought an injunction to block it.  Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett, of the Delaware Chancery Court, denied the request for an injunction because he said the settlement hadn't been presented to him.  However, the judge's July 19 opinion left little doubt that, if the settlement were submitted, he would have serious questions -- among them, a failure by Sen. Gore's special committee to hire its own lawyer (the lawyer appears to have been selected by Occidental and has worked for Dr. Hammer), the "huge attorney fees" involved, questions of who really owns the art to be displayed in the museum, and "the lack of any direct substantial benefit to the stockholders."  South Korea posted a trade surplus of $103 million in July, its largest in seven months but far narrower than its $708 million surplus a year earlier, the Trade and Industry Ministry reported.  The nation's trade surplus for the first seven months of 1989 plunged to $166 million from $3.79 billion in the like period of 1988.  The narrowing was attributed to sluggish exports and expanding imports.  Officials said South Korean exports in July rose 0.8% from a year earlier to $5.24 billion, while imports jumped 14% to $5.14 billion.  Exports in the first seven months were up 5.8% to $34.41 billion, while imports soared 19% to $34.25 billion.  Ashland Oil Inc., Nicor Inc. and Oracle Systems Corp. shares were added to Standard & Poor's Corp. index of 500 stocks.  They replace ASA International Ltd., Ideal Basic Industries Inc. and Warner Communications Inc., which have been the subject of recent takeover agreements.  In addition, First Interstate Bancorp was added to the S&P 100-stock index, replacing Warner Communications.  Chicago's futures markets trace their roots to the mid-19th century grain trade, but they have been transformed by explosive growth and innovation over the past decade.  Trading volume increased tenfold as a dizzying array of exotic financial products -- including futures on foreign currencies, Eurodollar deposits held outside the U.S., and stock indexes -- made Chicago an integral link in the international financial system.  As volume soared, so did the personal incomes of the hundreds of successful traders, many in their 20s and 30s, who migrated to the free market Mecca of the Midwest.  Trading pits swelled to bursting with hundreds of traders battling for a piece of the action.  But in the process, according to federal prosecutors, trading rules and customs were regularly bent, if not broken, by scores of traders on both exchanges.  What triggered the government investigation?  About three years ago, Dwayne Andreas, chairman of the huge grain processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., complained to the U.S. attorney about alleged price gouging by traders in the futures pit at the Chicago Board of Trade.  Within months, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began placing agents posing as traders in the soybean and Treasury bond futures pits at the Board of Trade, and later in the stock index, Japanese yen and Swiss franc futures trading pits across town at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  The government "moles" remained in place, taping conversations with unsuspecting futures traders and gathering other evidence, until late last December or early January.  The undercover sting operation was disclosed in mid-January as federal agents bearing subpoenas made late-night visits to the homes of dozens of shocked traders in the Chicago area.  Forty-six traders were indicted yesterday, based on evidence gathered by the investigation, and more indictments are expected in coming weeks.  What are the charges against the indicted traders?  The traders are charged with defrauding customers.  Mail fraud and wire fraud -- using the telephone -- are the specific statutes under which many traders were charged, but the alleged crimes occurred in the trading pits.  Traders used a number of tactics allegedly to circumvent the exchanges' open-outcry trading method, in which members bid competitively for orders.  Here are a few:  -- Prearranged trading occurs when two or more traders buy and sell futures among themselves without offering the orders to others in the pits.  -- Front-running involves brokers' trading ahead of large customer orders, which they have been given to execute, to profit from the market effect of the orders.  -- "Bucketing," a technique traders can employ to skim customer trading profits.  Why racketeering charges?  Several traders also have been charged with more serious fraud under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, law.  RICO allows the government to seek harsher penalties, including the seizure of assets and profits earned through the alleged illicit trading activities, than it can when traders are charged with separate instances of fraud.  The government alleges that indicted traders in certain cases used entire trading pits as racketeering enterprises, or vehicles for perpetrating fraud.  That doesn't mean every trader in these pits is charged with fraud, and an indictment in any case isn't a finding of guilt.  Critics of such broad use of RICO maintain that the statute was designed as a tool for fighting organized crime, not white-collar crimes such as futures trading fraud.  How have the exchanges policed their own markets?  The two exchanges have levied several million dollars in fines over the past few years against members and expelled several members, who were alleged to have broken trading rules.  They also have increased their back-office capability to monitor trading, in response to pressure from Congress and regulators.  But certain federal officials and exchange members themselves have questioned the fairness and thoroughness of the disciplinary process.  What about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission?  The federal regulator of the futures markets also investigates and fines traders, but it has been criticized since its formation in the mid-1970s for a light regulatory touch.  The commission also is heavily influenced by industry leaders and has backed down in past confrontations with the exchanges.  The CFTC is up for reauthorization, and congressional committees are ivnestigating what steps, if any, should be taken to make it a more effective agency.  How will the indictments affect customers?  Many indicted brokers may remain in the pits, handling customer orders until they go on trial.  If they do, they most likely will be on their best behavior.  Indeed, after subpoenas were handed out to traders in January, one Board of Trade member said, "The fills {prices at which orders are executed} have never been better."  Each pit has plenty of brokers to take the place of those who leave.  Not even the most optimistic prosecutor believes the 2 1/2-year federal investigation spells the end of customer complaints about Chicago's futures marekts.  But the penalties sought in many of yesterday's indictments are expected to act as stiff deterrents to flagrant trading abuses.  What is the potential effect on the exchanges?  So far, the picture has been mixed.  For the first seven months of this year, the Chicago Merc's trading volume increased about one-third from a year earlier.  Much of the increase came from higher volume in Eurodollar futures, which financial institutions use to hedge against moves in short-term interest rates.  At the Board of Trade, however, volume through July increased only about 1%.  But trading in soybean futures has fallen 15% since the investigation was announced, and some traders believe that at least some of the decline is the result of the government investigation.  Some traders say the Board of Trade's embarrassing squabble last month with Feruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. of Italy about its activities in soybean futures might never have happened if the market hadn't lost so much liquidity.  In that dispute, the exchange's emergency order forcing traders to close out positions in July-delivery soybeans gave the Board of Trade a black eye in international trading circles.  Nevertheless, the futures exchanges seem certain to survive.  Their trading pits offer such great opportunity that other risk-takers will replace those who leave.  Also, many of their markets are important to the commodity merchants that use them to price inventories and future transactions.  Japan's Transmissions  Take Technology Lead  THE JAPANESE EDGE in automobile-engine technology now extends to transmissions.  Japanese auto makers have been ahead of their Detroit rivals in developing "multivalve" engines, which have four valves per cylinder instead of the standard two, and thus boost performance without sacrificing fuel economy.  Now Nissan Motor Co. has developed for two cars sold only in Japan an electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission.  The Nissan transmission is the first of its kind, and its main attributes are improved fuel economy and smoother driving.  None of the Big Three have anything like it in their plans through the mid-1990s.  Chrysler Corp. came out with its first four-speed automatic transmission just last fall, and early quality glitches gave it a rocky start and sent warranty claims soaring.  Ford Motor Co. could adapt the four-speed automatic used on the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable to handle a fifth gear, but doing so would be expensive.  "It isn't a hard thing to do" technically, a Ford official says.  "It would just add costs, maybe another $50 a vehicle."  The trouble is, adding cost is worrisome to Detroit auto makers, who are still struggling to erase Japanese manufacturers' lower-cost advantage.  The Japanese have another reason to push faster on product technology: Consumers in Japan typically see cars as a recreational item and are willing to spend more for the latest advances.  But Americans tend to use their cars for basic transporation and are more reluctant to pay for new frills.  Now It's Caveat Emptor  When Picking Car Wax  NOTHING IS simple anymore, not even waxing the car.  Traditional car waxes may actually scratch the "clear-coat" finish that's applied to most new cars nowadays.  About 80% of the cars now on the road were covered with clear-coat finish at the factory to protect the underlying paint from fading.  Others -- mainly older cars but some new ones as well -- have nothing protecting their enamel paints, making them vulnerable to oxidation.  As a result, wax makers formulated many of their products with abrasives to cut through oxidation.  But the abrasives that helped older finishes sparkle can scratch softer clear coats.  "It's like taking a piece of plexiglas and rubbing it with a very fine sandpaper," says J.D. Culea, president of Northern Laboratories Inc., the maker of Kit car wax.  "A lot of people don't realize what they're doing."  That's because most don't know whether their cars have clear-coat finishes.  Not all plants have clear-coat paint shops.  So some cars don't get a clear coat, while cars of the same model built at another plant do.  New waxes are available that won't mar clear-coat finishes.  Auto makers and wax makers advise owners to find out what's on the car and what's in the wax before they start rubbing.  Miata Success Story  Has Curious Twists  THE SUCCESS of Mazda Motor Co.'s sporty two-seater convertible, the MX-5 Miata, is fraught with ironies.  One big one: The new car's assistant chief designer was Mark Jordan, the son of Charles M. Jordan, vice president of design for General Motors Corp.  Three years ago, GM developed a prototype car similar in concept -- though not exactly in shape -- to the Miata, which evokes images of the classic British roadsters of the 1960s.  The GM car was called "B2B" for "back to basics," but the company chose not to put it into production.  Another irony: Miata fans angry at the hefty premiums dealers are exacting for the hot-selling car have some unusual company -- Mazda's own executives.  Auto makers have no legal right to dictate prices to dealers, as Mazda dealers are quick to point out.  But Mazda is angry that dealers are demanding $3,000 or more above the sticker price (about $13,800) for a vehicle the company touts as "affordable."  Mazda is having its field sales staff "counsel" dealers that overcharging people isn't good business.  The company sent dealers a letter conveying a similar message and plans to raise the issue at a dealer meeting this month.  "If we intended for this car to sell for $3,000 more, we would have charged it," says Mazda's U.S. sales and marketing chief, George McCabe.  Daytime Car Lights  May Prevent Accidents  DRIVING WITH lights on in the daytime may look dumb, but it's safer than driving with them off.  That's what the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says.  The Institute is promoting the use of "daytime running lights," which it says help reduce accidents.  Daytime running lights can be low-beam headlights or regular parking lights, on the front or side of the car -- any lights that are kept on during the day.  Two years ago, the institute outfitted 2,000 rental cars with automatic daytime lights and leased an identical fleet without them.  The result: 7% fewer accidents in cars that kept the lights on.  Saab-Scania AG, the Swedish auto maker, also supports daytime light use.  And Canada recently passed a law requiring that all vehicles sold in the country beginning in December be outfitted with automatic daytime lights.  But critics say daytime lights are helpful only in northern nations like Canada, where dusk lasts longer.  One obstacle in the U.S. is a hodgepodge of state laws, including some that restrict daytime lights to police cars or cars in funeral processions.  Rates on fixed mortgages are approaching two-year lows, with economists expecting rates to tumble further this month.  The declines have sparked modest increases in house sales.  In the past week, increasing numbers of lenders have cut rates on 30-year fixed-rate loans to a range of 9.25% to 9.5% from a range of 9.5% to 9.75% the previous week.  Since May, rates on fixed-rate mortgages have declined by 1 1/2 percentage points.  A national survey of 2,000 lenders by HSH Associates, of Butler, N.J., indicates that more than 550 lenders currently offer fixed-rate loans below 10%, double the number just a month ago.  These lenders have undercut the indicated rate for a 30-year fixed loan purchased by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  That rate fell to 9.92% early this week from 10.03% last week.  Fully-indexed rates on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell slightly to 10.38% early this week from 10.45% the previous week.  The declines, economists said, are largely the result of the slowing economy.  The Federal Reserve Board -- which exerted pressure on interest rates as a way to fight the threat of inflation -- has pulled back from the tactic recently as several government economic reports indicate that growth has cooled.  In addition, several big banks in recent days have reduced their prime rate, which also typically signals cheaper borrowing costs for consumers.  Additional mortgage-rate declines are expected through mid-August before stabilizing for the rest of the summer and through the fall, economists said.  Some economists projected declines of one-eighth of one percentage point.  They said that single-digit fixed-rate loans would be available for a sustained period for the first time since 1987.  The rate declines have helped fuel increases in sales of new and existing homes.  The National Association of Home Builders reported that new-home sales increased 5.51% in June, for the third straight month, to 670,000 units from 635,000 units in May at an annualized rate.  Existing home sales rose 5.92% in June, to 3.4 million units at an annual rate from 3.21 million in May.  The lower rates have improved some markets.  In New York City, for instance, Corcoran Group, a brokerage firm that sells Manhattan condominiums and cooperatives, said July sales ballooned 40% compared with June.  Despite the improved housing picture, housing economists said the latest decline in rates would only have a modest effect on sales.  They said the rate declines and the wider availability of single-digit loans are developments that are still too new to generate a surge in sales.  High housing prices requiring increasing hefty down payments have blocked some consumers from buying.  New-home prices climbed 8.3% in June, to a median of $129,900, according to the National Association of Home Builders.  Existing homes prices edged up to a median $93,200 from $92,600 the previous month, the National Association of Realtors said.  Demographics also have been a drag on housing sales; the pool of potential buyers has shrunk as baby boomers have aged.  "The (consumer) response to lower rates will be a moderate one," said Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.  Indeed, major home builders, mortgage lenders and real-estate brokers said they don't expect the recent decline -- as well as previous declines earlier this summer -- to produce significant results for the industry.  Said Larry Flick, managing partner for Roach Brothers Realty, Devon, Pa.: "There's a lot of activity, but no sales yet.  Which is surprising."  First Security Corp., Salt Lake City, said it agreed in principle to acquire United Savings Bank in a stock swap with an indicated value of about $35 million.  United Savings, Salem, Ore., has assets of about $204 million and operates nine full service branches and one loan-origination office in the Salem area.  Under terms of the agreement, holders of United Savings' 1.7 million shares outstanding will receive 0.69 share of First Security for each United Savings share swapped.  First Security has been trading in the range of $30 to $31 a share; in overthe-counter trading, the shares closed at $30, down 75 cents.  United Savings holders also may receive a cash bonus of as much as 75 cents a share, predicated upon the earnings of the Salem banking concern between July 1 and the date of closing.  First Security said the acquisition, subject to approval by regulators and United Savings holders, is expected to close by year end.  First Security, with 163 banking offices in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, has assets of $5.3 billion.  A new study showing hefty increases in cable television rates is likely to spur Congressional action to reregulate the industry or foster competition.  The General Accounting Office study, scheduled to be released today at a House telecommunications subcommittee hearing, found that average monthly rates for cable operators' lowest-priced service soared 29% from an average of $11.23 in December 1986, as the industry was being deregulated, to $14.48 last October.  Rates for the most popular basic service -- generally the same as the cheapest service -- jumped 26% from an average of $11.70 to $14.77.  The number of channels offered also grew: to 30 from 24 for the lowest-priced service and to 32 from 27 for the most popular service.  The GAO found that about 30% of cable subscribers had rate increases exceeding 40% over the 23 months.  In that time, the consumer price index rose about 8%.  "Congress must step in and do something" about this "dramatic change in prices since deregulation," says Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America.  Consumer Federation studies have concluded that effective competition would halve monthly cable bills for most consumers, saving $6 billion a year.  The cable industry, which has lobbied hard against reregulation, argues that prices had been kept artifically low by regulation.  James Mooney, head of the National Cable Television Association, says the surge in rates after deregulation reflected pent-up price pressure.  That has eased -- in part, he acknowledges, because cable operators fear reregulation.  In the first half of this year, he notes, cable prices as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics rose 1.6%, compared with overall inflation of 3%.  Moreover, Mr. Mooney says, cable operators are offering better programming as well as more channels.  He says the average monthly cost per channel has remained nearly flat at 46 cents.  Meantime, revenue has risen.  The GAO study found cable operators' monthly revenue per subscriber rose 14% in the 23 months to $24.68.  The study noted, however, that after adjusting for inflation, the increase was around 8%.  The GAO also found that despite the rate increases, more customers are signing up: 15% more subscribers overall and 14% more subscribers to premium services, such as Home Box Office and Showtime.  Cable penetration, or total subscribers divided by homes that can get cable, also rose, to 57% from 55%.  More than 49 million households get cable service.  The study was commissioned by the telecommunications subcommittee in response to complaints from constituents about higher cable rates and lower-quality service.  Lawmakers have been exploring a variety of measures, from stepping in and letting local governments reimpose rate ceilings to allowing local telephone companies to provide some competition.  In all, 13 cable bills have been introduced.  Lawmakers see pressure building to allow telephone companies limited entry into the cable arena.  Rep. Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat, says the GAO study "makes the case that we need to change" cable's status as an unregulated monopoly service.  He wants to lift rules barring phone companies from providing cable service and to allow local regulation where competition doesn't exist.  Here are sketches of some of the traders indicted in the Justice Department's investigation of Chicago's futures markets:  SAM A. CALI (charged with RICO, RICO conspiracy, 41 counts of mail and wire fraud and 58 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act): This 38-year-old broker is one of the most influential traders in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Japanese yen pit.  He's a former member of the largest broker association on the floor as well as the yen-pit committee, which arbitrates trader disputes.  Until earlier this year, Mr. Cali was a broker with ABS Partners, a powerful broker group with ties to John F. Sandner, a former Merc chairman and now a top policy adviser and director.  Mr. Cali apparently was targeted early in the FBI's investigation.  He was disciplined by the Merc in November in the wake of separate allegations about prearranged trading.  He was charged earlier this week by the Merc in a single-count disciplinary action with prearranged trading and failing to cooperate with the exchange's internal probe.  Thomas Durkin, Mr. Cali's attorney, said: "I think he is innocent.  I don't think these customers were defrauded.  It's like asking people whether they were defrauded by the way the blackjack player cuts the deck in Vegas."  JOHN M. BAKER (charged with RICO, RICO conspiracy, 20 counts of mail and wire fraud and 25 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act): One of the wildest dressing, most visible and busiest traders in the yen pit, the 50-year-old Mr. Baker was apparently targeted early in the probe by an FBI agent using the alias Peter Vogel.  The agent was trying to persuade traders to participate in a tax-fraud scheme involving the use of his account to conceal profits on successful trades.  A former encyclopedia salesman whose telephone-answering machine features the voice of Daffy Duck, Mr. Baker is said by some traders to have made an annual trading income well into six figures.  On the trading floor, he is known for his purple paisley jacket and exotic ties, selected to catch the attention of buyers or sellers in the crowded pits.  For him and others, the federal probe has inspired dark humor: According to other traders, he recently yelled across the pit to a colleague, "I'm going to jail and taking you with me as my caddy."  THOMAS A. CROUCH (charged with RICO, RICO conspiracy, 19 counts of mail and wire fraud and 20 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act): A popular trader whose floor badge bears the nickname "Atom," Mr. Crouch formed a partnership with John Baker.  The 43-year-old trader has acknowledged trading contracts with FBI undercover agent Peter Vogel -- whom he described as a clean-cut "hayseed."  One of the few exchange members to comment publicly, in a February Chicago Tribune article, he has publicly denied participating in the tax-fraud scheme Mr. Vogel allegedly offered several traders.  He isn't considered one of the bigger players in the yen pit, with income estimated in the low six figures.  He was recently charged by the Merc with a single prearranged trade and failure to cooperate with its internal investigation.  Mr. Crouch and his attorney couldn't be reached.  BRIAN E. SLEDZ (charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of violating the Commodities Exchange Act): This 29-year-old broker, who netted more than $1 million at the Merc last year, was targeted early in the FBI probe, sources say.  In late July, the Merc brought disciplinary charges against him and three other traders for alleged prearranged trading with the FBI's mole in the yen pit.  Last Jan. 19, he sold his International Monetary Market seat at the Merc for $350,000, an indicated profit of $147,000 from his $203,000 purchase price in June 1986 -- big money for a former jewelry store salesman and electronic-parts inspector.  But the Merc held on to proceeds of the seat sale, citing pending disciplinary and legal proceedings.  Mr. Sledz, whose attorney has indicated the trader is cooperating with investigators, and his lawyers argued in a lawsuit in Illinois state court that the Merc had made no formal charges against Mr. Sledz when he sold his seat.  They said he needed the money to pay a "substantial federal income tax obligation" and that late payments would cost him "substantial penalties and interest."  They also said Mr. Sledz, a college dropout, needed part of the proceeds for his share of a partnership to buy and subdivide property in Kane County, Ill.  Barry Spevack, attorney for Mr. Sledz, said he expects the trader to plead guilty to one count of mail or wire fraud and one count of violating the Commodities Exchange Act.  JAMES G. SLEDZ (charged with one count of mail fraud and one count of violating the Commodities Exchange Act): Younger brother of Brian Sledz, James Sledz is said to have netted nearly $200,000 at the Merc in 1988.  The 24-year-old, who also is thought to have cooperated with investigators, left the exchange the same day as his brother.  He was charged by the Merc in July with two counts of prearranged trading in connection with yen-pit trades with an FBI undercover agent.  Mr. Spevack, who is also the attorney for the younger Mr. Sledz, said he expects his client to plead guilty to one count of mail or wire fraud and one count of violating the Commodities Exchange Act.  MARTIN J. DEMPSEY JR. (charged with RICO, RICO conspiracy, 37 counts of mail and wire fraud and 83 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act): This prominent broker in the Chicago Board of Trade's soybean pit sold his seat on the exchange right after news of the scandal broke.  The tall, athletic-looking 52-year-old was a clerk at Reynolds & Co., a trading concern, in the 1960s, advanced to become a floor manager, then left to buy a seat of his own.  Other traders say that over the past two decades, Mr. Dempsey made a substantial fortune, with annual income estimated at well into six figures, lost much of it and then rebounded.  A relative of Mr. Dempsey's said the trader wouldn't comment.  SHELDON H. SCHNEIDER (charged with RICO conspiracy, four counts of mail fraud and five counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act): "Time to better one's self," Mr. Schneider once wrote as his reason for becoming a soybean trader.  That notation in a personnel file was his explanation for leaving a food wholesaling job to learn the ropes at the Chicago Board of Trade; Mr. Schneider, who graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in economics, had his eye on bigger things.  So far though, he is viewed by fellow traders as a relatively small player.  On the exchange floor, Mr. Schneider, 46, spends a lot of time with his arms folded, peering through his glasses from the rear of the pit.  Mr. Schneider and his attorney couldn't be reached.  JAMES D. NOWAK (charged with RICO, RICO conspiracy, 56 counts of mail and wire fraud, 180 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act, filing a false tax return and conspiracy to defraud the IRS): This 47-year-old soybean broker first learned the commodities business by lending money to traders, spending 14 years as a commercial banking officer at Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago.  He left in 1974.  In at least one way, his biography is typical of professionals lured into Chicago's fast-paced pits: Many cut short their formal education, either before they begin working in the industry, or soon thereafter.  Although Mr. Nowak took afterwork classes in finance at Chicago's DePaul University from 1971 to 1978, he never graduated.  Instead, he learned the rules of the exchange floor during a stint as a vice president of operations in the CBOT's clearing bureaucracy, then became a broker in 1978.  He isn't considered a star by his peers.  James Streicker, attorney for Mr. Nowak, said, "We intend to enter a plea of not guilty and contest the charges.  The size of this indictment is certainly monumental and it's gross overkill."  BRUCE MITTELSTADT (charged with RICO conspiracy, 16 counts of wire fraud, 39 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act, and one count of lying to a federal agency): A tall trader who occupied a regular spot near the bottom of the CBOT soybean pit, this 49-year-old is the son of a trader.  Thus, he typifies the sort of heritage exchange officials hope to foster: family members passing along skills and ethics.  "You can ask anyone about Bruce Mittelstadt; he's probably one of the classiest, cleanest guys on any exchange," says another trader.  But his colleagues say he had a double misfortune: One of his big clients was Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the company whose complaint to federal officials touched off the probe.  And in the pit each day, Mr. Mittelstadt's regular vantage point was just a few feet from Richard Carlson, one of the undercover FBI agents.  James Montana, Mr. Mittelstadt's attorney, said a jury will find his client acted with "honor" and didn't cheat clients.  The Treasury said it plans to sell $29.5 billion of notes and bonds to raise about $13.6 billion cash and redeem $15.9 billion of maturing government securities.  In order for the sales to take place, Congress first must increase the federal government's current debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion.  The new securities, part of the government's regular quarterly refunding operation will consist of:  -- $10 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned Tuesday.  -- $9.75 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned Wednesday.  -- $9.75 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned next Thursday.  The three-year notes will mature on Aug. 15, 1992, the 10-year notes on Aug. 15, 1999, and the 30-year bonds on Aug 15, 2019.  However, the Treasury has virtually exhausted its authority to borrow funds.  At a news conference to announce the refunding, Robert Glauber, Treasury undersecretary of finance, said the department may have to postpone the auctions until Congress passes legislation raising the current $2.8 trillion debt limit.  On Tuesday, the House passed a bill that would lift the ceiling to $2.87 trillion through Oct. 31.  The Senate is scheduled to act on a similar measure before Congress adjourns for a month-long recess at the end of the week.  The new auctions would bring the Treasury's net borrowing this quarter to $16.4 billion.  The department estimates a total net borrowing need of $22 billion in marketable securities, assuming a $30 billion cash balance at the end of September.  That, however, could increase.  If the funding for the huge savings-and-loan bill nearing congressional passage is included in the federal budget, Mr. Glauber said, the Treasury could need to borrow as much as $15 billion more before the quarter ends.  The Bush administration opposes on-budget financing for the S&L bill.  In addition to the note and bond auctions, the Treasury said it will issue on Monday $5 billion in cash-management bills, which will mature Sept. 21.  Next quarter, the Treasury will probably need to borrow between $50 billion and $55 billion, assuming a $20 billion cash balance by the end of December.  American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. have formed a partnership to expand in interactive telephone marketing.  The new company, Call Interactive, will use the telephone lines for an array of sales and market-research services.  The announcement comes less than a week after AT&T won in a federal court the right to enter electronic publishing.  It also follows heavy speculation about how the telecommunications giant will move into information services.  An American Express spokesman said, however, that the venture has been under discussion for months, and the timing of the announcement is unrelated to the court decision.  Call Interactive, which will make its debut in September, will process thousands of calls simultaneously using 800 and 900 telephone numbers.  Pending approval by the Federal Communications Commission, the new system will be able to process as many as 10,000 calls in 90 seconds.  The new service will allow companies to gain instant access to mass audiences who can participate in contests or offer reactions to new products.  Call Interactive, to be based in Omaha, Neb., is a successor to another American Express unit that uses interactive telephone technology, FDR Interactive Technologies, formed in May 1988.  While both companies have been involved in interactive phone services, AT&T gives the venture access to its network of 80 million homes and seven million businesses.  American Express, through its American Express Information Services Co. unit, comes to the deal with an established customer base for such services and patented technology to handle vast call volume, a spokesman for the travel and financial services company said.  While interactive telephone services are considered a growth area in the electronics field, the industry has been criticized by some consumer groups and state agencies.  They are concerned about the tactics of some telephone marketers who don't adequately disclose fees for interactive calls and about the services' appeal to children.  Call Interactive will have a limiting feature that can prevent repeat calls from a single caller, such as a child repeatedly phoning in a contest entry.  The companies say businesses that purchase the interactive service will be able to take thousands of simultaneous orders.  Entertainment programs will be able to access audience reaction through phone lines.  Appeals for participants in medical studies will be able to reach a larger-than-usual pool of willing subjects in minutes.  THE SENATE ADOPTED a $305 billion defense measure for fiscal 1990.  By a 95-4 vote, the chamber endorsed Bush's proposals for new strategic weapons but rejected parts of his spending plan for conventional arms.  The defense-authorization legislation supports the development of the B-2 Stealth bomber, a proposed space-based anti-missile system, and a pair of mobile nuclear missile systems.  The Senate's spending blueprint differs markedly from the House version, which sharply cuts spending on the administration's strategic priorities.  House and Senate conferees are expected to face lengthy and difficult negotiations next month to resolve the disparities between the two measures.  ---  BUSH EXPRESSED frustration over a lack of data about Mideast hostages.  With a fundamentalist Moslem group in Lebanon threatening to kill American captive Joseph Cicippio today unless Israel releases a Shiite cleric, the president said a lack of precise information about the Americans being held or their captors was hampering his ability "to make a decision" in the crisis.  The Navy, meanwhile, began moving warships in the direction of Lebanon and Iran, giving the president a ready military option as officials continued to press diplomatic efforts.  A U.N. official arrived in Lebanon to seek the body of hostage Lt. Col. Higgins amid a report that Shiite kidnappers might spare Cicippio at Iran's behest.  ---  Poland's Kiszczak was elected premier after the Parliament's Communist-led coalition overcame internal rifts.  The move secured the party's control of the government.  The ex-interior minister, an enforcer of the 1981 crackdown on Solidarity, said he would move to provide food to the nation, which is facing shortages and higher prices.  ---  Apartheid foes in South Africa launched a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience to protest next month's segregated parliamentary elections.  Several hundred black and mixed-race activists sought treatment at whites-only hospitals, mainly in Durban and Johannesburg.  All those appearing in need of medical care reportedly were admitted.  --- The Navy conducted the first successful test firing of a Trident-2 nuclear missile from a submerged submarine.  A Soviet trawler was warned away from the area as the unarmed missile was fired off Cape Canaveral at an undisclosed target in the Atlantic.  A flotilla of anti-nuclear protesters last week caused a delay of the test.  ---  A HUD report indicates that profiteering in programs meant for low- and moderate-income residents by well-connected consultants is more widespread than previously reported.  According to the agency's inspector general, 20 different consultants were paid more than $5.7 million to help channel projects to developers.  ---  The Senate Labor Committee approveda bill that would substantially restrict discrimination against handicapped persons by employers and concerns that serve the public.  The measure was cleared after a final round of negotiations between senators and the White House.  ---  A federal jury in Washington awarded $50 million to the families of 137 passengers killed when a Korean Air Lines jetliner strayed into Soviet airspace and was downed by a missile-firing fighter jet in 1983.  All 269 people aboard the aircraft were killed.  The six-member jury found the KAL crew guilty of willful misconduct.  ---  The House approved a $138 billion labor, health and education bill that provides for continued growth in AIDS research and a more than 20% increase in aid for low-income public school children in elementary grades.  The chamber also upheld a bid to roll back current abortion restrictions in Washington.  ---  A Siberian miners' leader called for the creation of independent trade unions to replace official bodies.  Miners in the region staged a weeklong strike last month.  Meanwhile, the head of the Soviet Union's government-controlled unions presented a draft law to Moscow's legislature to allow workers to strike if binding arbitration fails.  ---  Rafsanjani is scheduled to be sworn in today as Iran's fourth president, Tehran's official radio said.  Rafsanjani, who served as parliamentary speaker for nine years, succeeds Ali Khamenei, whose second four-year term was to expire in October.  Khamenei became Iran's spiritual leader following Ayatollah Khomeini's June 3 death.  ---  South Korean police detained opposition leader Kim Dae Jung and questioned him about an unauthorized trip to North Korea by a colleague.  Clashes erupted between riot police and Kim's supporters near the Seoul police station where he was held.  ---  Cambodia's Hun Sen said he wants free elections to be held within three months after Vietnam completes its troop withdrawal in September.  The Hanoi-backed premier made his remarks in Paris following Tuesday's close of a three-day peace conference.  Ministers at the forum agreed to a mechanism for monitoring the pullout.  ---  A leading Chinese intellectual has fled to the West, an activist in Hong Kong said.  Chen Yizi, the former director of an influential Beijing think tank, is suspected of acting as a link between deposed Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and the crushed studentled pro-democracy movement.  Komatsu Ltd. of Japan said it has acquired a 24.9% stake in a fellow maker of construction machinery, Hanomag AG of West Germany, and is considering boosting its holding to more than 50%.  The price of the 24.9% stake wasn't disclosed.  Komatsu officials said the acquisition is designed to forge close long-term relations with Hanomag and promote development of new products for sale in Europe.  There will be no change in the management of Hanomag, officials said.  The Hong Kong government agreed to sell Hang Lung Bank, leaving the state responsible for only one of the institutions it took control of during a wave of bank problems in the early and mid-1980s.  The buyer is Dao Heng Holdings Ltd., whose banking subsidiary, Dao Heng Bank, should get a big boost from Hang Lung's branch network.  The sale will make Dao Heng the fifth largest bank in Hong Kong.  A statement from Dao Heng and the government said the two sides will discuss details and a further announcement will be made after the contract is signed.  The statement didn't disclose the amount paid for Hang Lung.  The last bank under government control, Overseas Trust Bank, probably won't be sold soon.  Many lawsuits related to bad loans have yet to be resolved.  Kaufhof AG has agreed to acquire 58% of Oppermann AG from Juergen Oppermann, the chairman of the West German mail-order company.  Kaufhof, a West German retailing group in which Metro International AG of Switzerland holds a majority stake, will acquire 464,000 shares of Oppermann for an undisclosed amount.  Trading in Oppermann's shares, which were first offered to the public in October for 685 marks each ($366.90), was suspended yesterday with the price at 628 marks.  At that price, the stake purchased by Kaufhof would be valued at about 290 million marks ($155.3 million).  AEG AG, the electrical subsidiary of West German auto group Daimler-Benz AG, said it has received a 400 million-mark ($214.2 million) order from the Canadian Postal Service to supply fully automated letter sorters.  These are some of the most successful products of AEG, which says it has a 60% share of the global market for letter sorters.  The Canadian order is the second from North America for AEG-designed letter sorters this year.  ElectroCom Inc., a U.S. company that has a licensing agreement with AEG, earlier received orders totaling 830 million marks ($444.6 million) to supply letter-sorting systems to the U.S. Postal Service.  BEAR STEARNS Cos. declared its second stock dividend this year and reported a jump in fiscal fourth quarter profits.  The New York brokerage firm declared a 5% stock dividend, payable Aug. 31 to shares of record Aug. 15, and a regular quarterly of 14 cents with the same dates.  The company also paid a 5% stock dividend in May.  Net income rose to $47.6 million, or 50 cents a share, from $20.8 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $629.7 million from $485.8 million.  IMPERIAL OIL Ltd., Toronto, said it plans to raise 300 million Canadian dollars (US$254 million) through a 10-year debenture issue to reduce short-term debt incurred in its US$4.15 billion acquisition of Texaco Canada Inc.  The 9.875% issue is priced at par to mature Dec. 15, 1999.  The underwriting group consists of RBC Dominion Securities Inc., ScotiaMcLeod Inc., Wood Gundy Inc., Burns Fry Ltd., Gordon Capital Corp. and Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., all of Toronto.  Imperial, 69.6%-owned by New York-based Exxon Corp., raised C$1 billion through an issue of shares to repay some of the debt from the Texaco Canada acquisition.  The House approved legislation that would raise the legal ceiling on the federal government's debt to $2.87 trillion through Oct. 31.  The measure passed on a 231-185 vote.  To avert a default later this month, the Senate is expected to act on the bill before leaving at the end of this week for a four-week recess.  Under the House-passed measure, the debt ceiling would revert to the current level of $2.8 trillion Nov. 1.  By that date, lawmakers expect to have approved legislation raising the debt ceiling to $3.123 trillion, estimated to be enough to last through the end of fiscal 1990 on Sept. 30, 1990.  Congressional budget writers believe the longer-term extension measure could be a vehicle for a possible budget agreement between lawmakers and President Bush for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, 1990.  The bill also would provide that Treasury-issued zero-coupon bonds, which pay interest at maturity rather than periodically, be counted under the debt limit at their current accrual value rather than face value.  That accounting change, sought by the Treasury, would reduce the amount of federal borrowing subject to the debt limit by about $15 billion, according to congressional estimates.  Last year, the Treasury issued zero-coupon bonds to help refinance Mexico's debt and may issue more in connection with other international debt problems and to deal with the savings-and-loan problem.  INSPIRATION RESOURCES CORP. declared an initial dividend and said it plans to pay a quarterly of three cents a share.  The New York-based natural resources company declared an initial dividend of six cents a share for the first two quarters of 1989, payable Sept. 15, to stock of record Aug. 15.  Its Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting Co. subsidiary in Canada will pay the Canadian dollar equivalent of that dividend on Hudson Bay special shares, which are exchangeable one-for-one for Inspiration shares.  Chairman Reuben F. Richards said the dividend decision "reflects confidence in our ability to sustain our long-term profitability through continuing improved performance as well as acquisition of businesses that will provide us with predictable earnings and cash flow."  The company said net for the second quarter rose 21% to $36.2 million, or 54 cents a share, from $29.9 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.  Revenue declined to $608.8 million from $622.2 million.  Year-earlier results included $67 million in revenue and operating income of $6.3 million from its former U.S. copper unit.  TORONTO-DOMINION BANK, Toronto, said it plans to issue 200 million Canadian dollars ($169.3 million) of non-cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares.  The issue, which is co-led by Scotia-McLeod Inc. and Toronto Dominion Securities Inc., carries a dividend rate of 9% which can be adjusted upward depending on future increases in common stock dividends.  The preferred is non-redeemable for five years and thereafter at a premium which declines to par after the 10th year.  The shares can be redeemed for cash or for common stock of the bank issued at 95% of the then current market price.  Proceeds will be added to the bank's general funds, Toronto-Dominion said.  Marine Transport Lines Inc. said the ocean-shipping company agreed to be acquired by Intrepid Acquisition Corp. for $25.25 a share, or a total of $73.2 million.  A previous $20-a-share merger offer from a group including Marine Transport's chairman has been terminated, the company said.  When the earlier offer was reported in late June, Marine Transport said it would consider other offers and that a special committee had been appointed to evaluate all bids.  Intrepid is a recently formed Delaware corporation whose investors include its president, Richard T. duMoulin, the former chief operating officer of OMI Corp., a shipping company.  Other investors in Intrepid include an affiliate of First City Financial Corp., which is controlled by the Belzberg family of Canada.  The closing of the merger with Intrepid is subject to certain conditions, including the approval of Marine Transport's shareholders.  Also, Marine Transport said it agreed to pay certain of Intrepid's acquisition expenses and to make other payments to Intrepid under certain conditions.  Marine Transport said Intrepid is entering into agreements with certain shareholders of the company, including members of the special merger committee, who together control about 40% of Marine Transport's shares.  The agreements will give Intrepid the right to vote those shares in favor of the merger.  The agreements also give Intrepid the right, under certain conditions, to purchase the shares held by those shareholders for $25.25 each.  In national over-the-counter trading, Marine Transport closed at $23.75 a share, up $2.375.  The Federal National Mortgage Association said its $800 million of new, three-year debentures due Aug. 10, 1992, will yield 7.75%.  Fannie Mae also will sell $700 million of seven-year debentures due Aug. 12, 1996, yielding 7.9%.  And $200 million of 30-year debentures, due Aug. 12, 2019, will yield 8.1%.  All three issues were priced at par.  The three-year issue was priced at 29 basis points over the three-year Treasury note issue.  The seven-year issue was priced at 37 basis points over the seven-year Treasury note issue.  The 30-year issue was priced at 33 basis points over the Treasury's 30-year bond issue.  A basis point is equal to 1/100th of one percentage point.  Secondary trading for all issues begins at 8:20 a.m. EDT today.  Dana Corp. named its president and chief operating officer, Southwood J. Morcott, to the additional post of chief executive officer, succeeding Gerald B. Mitchell, who had held the position since 1979.  Mr. Mitchell, 62 years old, will remain chairman of the diversified vehicle-parts maker until early 1990, when he plans to retire, the company said.  Mr. Morcott, 51, was for some time the clear choice to succeed Mr. Mitchell, but until now, Mr. Mitchell hadn't said publicly when he would hand over control.  Under Mr. Mitchell's leadership, Dana shifted its focus away from making and supplying original-equipment auto parts, and moved instead to become a diversified maker and distributor of truck parts and replacement parts for vehicles.  The company also undertook a broad restructuring of its manufacturing operations, closing some large, older plants and replacing them with smaller regional facilities near big customers.  Mr. Morcott has been with Dana since 1963, when he began as a sales engineer.  He will continue to oversee Dana's four regional operating groups.  The impact of China's political turmoil has slowed the banking business in Hong Kong to the point where earnings forecasts are being reversed.  Analysts who once predicted that banks' earnings growth this year would match 1988's growth now expect a slowdown.  Even at the lower level, however, 1989 profit growth is expected to outpace that of banks in the U.S. and Britain.  On average, analysts say, profits of banks operating in Hong Kong grew slightly more than 20% last year.  As 1989 began, the banks believed they probably would match that growth this year.  And the outlook was bright during much of the first half, as unexpectedly strong earnings from financing the lively property market and from other business made up for profit lost as the local economy cooled in line with expectations.  But the June 4 massacre of students and bystanders in Beijing has changed the outlook.  Analysts now say that industrywide earnings growth of about 15% is likely, as uncertainty about the future of China and Hong Kong, which is scheduled to return to Chinese control in 1997, causes bank customers to reconsider their financing needs.  Bankers note that interest in borrowing has rebounded since June, but they remain unsure how much longer the general wait-and-see attitude of many major clients will last.  Such borrowers as property developers and factory owners are shelving or scrapping expansion plans made before June.  The once-lively interest in borrowing for projects in China has diminished sharply.  Banks that have been active real-estate lenders are the most at risk.  Real-estate lending last year totaled HK$145 billion (US$18.6 billion) and accounted for 32% of the loans extended in Hong Kong.  Now, amid the concern about Hong Kong's future, investors who had agreed to buy buildings have forfeited their deposits rather than risk a sharp downturn in property prices.  Major developers have put some projects on hold and kept properties off the market, and many prospective homeowners are postponing purchases.  Banks have lowered their valuations of buildings in Hong Kong by about 20% since the end of May, but sellers generally haven't made similar cuts in asking prices, so buyers are finding they need more of their own money.  Complicating the outlook is a slowing in American purchases of goods from Hong Kong; a staple of banks' business here is the financing of trans-Pacific trade.  However, it hasn't yet become clear how much less the U.S. is buying, so banks can't estimate how much business is being lost.  With those factors, "I have a gut feeling that things aren't going to be as good this year, but I can't quantify it yet," says Paul Selway-Swift, the head of local operations at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.  Even so, a relatively sluggish performance from banks in Hong Kong would compare favorably with results in other countries, whose economies are growing more slowly.  Analysts expect 1989 per-share earnings to grow 6.5% at big New York banks and 6% at British banks.  Moreover, the slowdown in Hong Kong has its good side, according to some local bankers.  They had been concerned that institutions were lending too much: The value of loans denominated in Hong Kong dollars rose 44% in 1989's first quarter, while deposits of Hong Kong dollars grew only 14%.  By June 4, "we had already reached a point where there was going to be a slowdown in lending," says Tony Nicolle, Hong Kong's banking commissioner.  "Maybe this was the excuse banks wanted."  Indeed, he adds that some banks already had been cutting back on real estate loans.  Lenders with large stakes in retail banking may be able to make up for lost profits by increasing their share of the market.  Many depositors in Hong Kong reacted to the events in Beijing by withdrawing their funds from Bank of China and its affiliates in the colony; the parent bank alone says it lost 10% to 15% of its local deposits.  Most of that money was redeposited in local banks.  Whether financing for Chinese exports is affected by the turmoil won't be known for some time.  Hong Kong-based traders are currently tapping credit arranged for orders booked long before the events in Beijing.  Bankers say it may be September or October before they see much change in the flow of trade financing.  Marcade Group Inc. said it completed the acquisition of RJMJ Inc., a South Carolina designer of moderate to higher priced women's apparel, with annual sales in excess of $100 million.  Terms weren't disclosed.  Marcade said the acquisition is expected to "make a significant contribution" to earnings, and will boost Marcade's annualized sales to more than $450 million.  Marcade makes women's, men's and boys' apparel.  Seventeen-year-old Junko Furuta was riding her bike home from work last spring when a gang of teen-age boys kidnapped her.  They took her to the home of two gang members, where they raped her, beat her, tortured her, burned her, starved her, and after 40 days of captivity, murdered her.  The boys then dumped her body in an oil drum, poured concrete over it and abandoned it in a vacant lot.  Police only discovered the crime when one of the boys, under questioning about a petty theft, poured out the tale.  Then the police made another shocking discovery: The parents of two of the gang members knew the girl had been in their house.  She sat at their dinner table at least once, police say, but they were too scared of their sons to intervene or even call the police.  Japanese were stunned by the crime, in much the same way Americans were by the recent incident in New York's Central Park in which a woman jogger was gang-raped and bludgeoned into a coma.  And, because of a recent string of brutal crimes by juveniles, some here fear Japan has caught what they call the "American disease."  "You can see the society collapsing," says Susumu Oda, one of Japan's most prominent child psychiatrists.  Echoes a headline in a weekly magazine: "The Devil -- Children of the Comics and Video Age . . .  U.S.-Style Violence, Will it Take Over Japan?"  To Americans, beset by a burgeoning crime rate, the extent of Japanese concern about crime may seem curious.  Japan's crime rate is the lowest of any industrialized nation.  The murder rate is one-eighth that of the U.S., thefts about one-fourth.  Most streets in Tokyo, a much bigger city than New York, are safe at night.  Moreover, the juvenile crime rate actually has fallen in recent years.  But criminologists say that is because there are fewer juveniles in Japan's aging population.  Juvenile crime tends to run in cycles, and when the cycle turns upward again, Japan could be in for unprecedented problems because juvenile crime has become more violent.  To the Japanese, their new delinquents resemble America's alienated youth of the 1950s -- whom Japanese know from movies such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "West Side Story."  If this "American disease" is untreated, some Japanese fear it is only a matter of time before Japan comes to resemble their vision of the U.S. -- a land of drugs, unemployment and crime.  Police note that gangsters from Hawaii, the Philippines and Taiwan are smuggling in more guns.  And police report an "Americanization" of drug use.  In 1988 they confiscated only half as many stimulants, which Japanese traditionally have used to stay awake at school or work, as in 1987, but five times as many "recreational" drugs such as marijuana and hashish.  Japanese also cite the same factors some Americans blame for U.S. juvenile crime: broken homes or absent fathers, and violence in television and comic books.  "Sooner or later," says Dr. Oda, "what is happening in America will happen here, perhaps in a watered-down form."  Japanese say their fears are valid because the character of the crimes and the criminals is so different from the past.  As evidence, they cite recent police investigations:  -- Three junior-high school boys strangled a seven-year-old boy in his apartment.  They waited for the boy's mother to return, then strangled her with a telephone cord.  -- Two brothers, ages 14 and 15, played the children's game of rock-scissors-paper to decide who would kill their 66-year-old grandmother.  They then killed her and stole her money.  -- A teen gang abducted a young couple motoring in the countryside, forcing the husband to watch them rape his wife and then forcing the wife to watch them slit her husband's throat.  They later killed the woman and dumped her body in the mountains.  -- Youth gangs clashed not far from Tokyo Disneyland and a 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death.  -- Teen motorcyclists beat a salaryman to death at a gas station with a metal tool box.  Psychologists who interview juvenile criminals say they notice a lack of feeling among such children toward others.  "How gruesome these incidents were and the lack of sympathy they evidenced shows how different they are from the past," says Masayuki Tamura, a psychologist with the National Research Institute of Police Science.  "They are becoming more and more cold-blooded," says Dr. Oda.  Adds Inspector Shigeru Morishita of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police juvenile section, "They don't know the limits.  They see crime as fun or play."  Oryx Energy Co. said a gas discovery in southeastern New Mexico flowed at a rate of two million cubic feet of gas a day through a 10/64-inch choke.  The discovery well is 1 1/2 miles south of the Grama Ridge Morrow Field.  Oryx, an independent oil and gas producer, has a 50% working interest in the discovery.  BTA Oil Producers of Midland, Texas, has the other 50% working interest and is the operator.  A membership on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange was sold yesterday for $125,000, down from $130,000 in the previous sale July 12 but well above the $77,000 paid Aug. 3, 1988.  Currently, the bid is at $92,500 and the offer at $135,000, an exchange spokeswoman said.  Starting a winery these days is a capital-intensive business.  Keeping it going costs a fortune, too, and with wine sales virtually flat, there are lots of people who think there's no money in it.  But don't tell that to the Benziger family, or the Fetzers of Mendocino, or the owners of Sutter Home, the Trincheros.  These families own three of the most successful premium wineries in California.  The Benzigers, who produce the popular Glen Ellen brand of Sonoma, grossed $65 million in sales last year -- not bad for a clan of Easterners that headed west from New York a mere decade ago and came out with its first wine in 1981.  "We started that first harvest with a hand press," recalls Mike Benziger, "and when it got dark we crushed grapes through the night using car headlights."  The winery was called Glen Ellen then and Mike Benziger was the wine maker.  His cousin Joe Benziger worked alongside him as cellar manager.  When I first visited the operation in 1982, Mike's parents, Bruno and Helen, were living in the frame farmhouse built as a school in 1870.  Mike and his young wife lived in cramped quarters a few steps away, in a former garage.  A couple of years ago, Mike and Bruno each built comfortable homes on hilltops overlooking the old schoolhouse (now an office), the winery and vineyards.  Since then a bushel of Benzigers has joined the enterprise in the hills of Glen Ellen, on 100 acres near the old Jack London ranch -- Mike's six brothers and sisters, as well as assorted cousins.  There are 55 in the extended family now, including three new Benzigers all less than a year old.  It was a great blow to the family when Bruno died in June.  There must have been something special about the energy at work here that brought success so quickly -- or maybe it was just luck.  Certainly timing had something to do with it.  Glen Ellen's first wine, the 1981 Sauvignon Blanc, won the Sweepstakes (best of show) award at the Sonoma Harvest Fair wine judging in 1982, when the winery was virtually unknown.  The sudden recognition worked magic (though it came as something of a shock to the natives, "Who do these New Yorkers think they are, coming out here and beating us at our own game?"), and the very first vintage sold out quickly.  There wasn't much of it, however, and the vineyard needed cash flow, so Bruno came up with the idea of a line of inexpensive wines, Proprietor's Reserve Red and White, that were first offered at $2.99 a bottle.  It was a brilliant move.  At the time, the early '80s, there was a huge surplus of good Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon available on the bulk wine market.  The Proprietor's Reserve White was 50% Chardonnay, the red was mostly Cabernet.  They were leagues ahead of generic jug wines in quality and style, and an incredible bargain that savvy wine drinkers were quick to snap up.  Once again, the Benzigers were overwhelmed by the response and scrambled to increase production.  "The tail began to wag the dog," Bruno was fond of saying.  Sales leaped to 1.5 million cases by 1987, with Proprietor's Reserve Chardonnay leading the pack.  In fact, the success of the Proprietor's Reserve line adversely affected sales of Glen Ellen's estate wines, barrel-aged Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Cabernet Sauvignon that were sold mostly to restaurants.  Restaurant-goers balked; they were used to seeing the Proprietor's Reserve Chardonnay in wine shops for $4.99 -- so why was this one on the wine list for $22?  This sort of confusion forced the family to give the estate wines a separate identity.  In 1988 they designed a new label for the wines made from their own vineyards, Benziger of Sonoma.  The Benziger Chardonnay retails for $11, still quite moderate in view of escalating Chardonnay prices, which currently average $14 to $16 at this quality level.  Meanwhile, Glen Ellen Proprietor's Reserve sales continue to soar.  The line has now expanded to include a Select Dry White, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot and White Zinfandel.  Glen Ellen projects sales of more than three million cases by the end of this year.  Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino has grown more slowly, but sales jumped dramatically in the last couple of years to well over a million cases.  The Fetzer clan consists of 11 brothers and sisters whose father founded the winery in 1968.  Barney Fetzer was an executive with Masonite Corp. in Oregon in the 1950s when he and Kathleen bought a ranch in Mendocino that was once a stagecoach stop between Ukiah and Fort Bragg, Calif.  They replanted the vineyards and began selling grapes to amateur wine makers.  When Barney retired he moved the family to Mendocino, built a winery and bottled his first 2,500 cases of wine under the Fetzer label in 1968.  Barney Fetzer died in 1981.  Eldest son John Fetzer is now president of Fetzer Vineyards and head of the large, close-knit family.  Ten of the brothers and sisters are involved with the business in some capacity or other, and their mother, Kathleen, is the driving force behind Fetzer's commitment to wine as a beverage with food.  A great cook herself and a formidable baker, she inspired the younger generation to make wine with food a priority in promoting Fetzer wines.  This spring the Fetzers opened the Valley Oaks Wine and Food Center at the Valley Oaks Vineyard in Hopland.  A lavish complex with a state-of-the-art kitchen and four-acre organic garden of vegetables, fruits and herbs, the center boasts a full schedule of dinners, cooking demonstrations and conferences.  Adjacent to the Fetzer tasting room on Highway 101 is the Sundial Grill, a restaurant featuring California cuisine with emphasis on local ingredients.  Sundial and Valley Oaks are key names.  Fetzer's success is largely due to the enormous popularity of its moderately priced varietals, Sundial Chardonnay and Valley Oaks Fume Blanc, which sell for about $7.50 and $6 respectively.  Fetzer makes a full line of varietal wines, all excellent value, especially the Barrel Select Zinfandel and Reserve Pinot Noir.  The Fetzer family controls some 3,000 acres of vineyard and expects sales to hit the two million mark by 1990.  The oldest winery in this trio of success stories is Sutter Home in Napa Valley.  Sutter Home started as a bulk wine producer in the mid-1940s.  In the mid-'60s, with a $32,000 loan from Wells Fargo that enabled the winery to purchase better grapes, second-generation wine maker Bob Trinchero set his sights higher.  He produced a rich, ripe Zinfandel from Amador County and created Sutter Home's reputation for the robust red that was popular in the '70s.  Sutter Home still makes red Zinfandel, but Bob Trinchero's biggest brainstorm was white Zinfandel, which isn't white at all, in fact.  The juice of the grape picks up a blush of color from the grape skins but then is drained off and fermented like a white wine.  Sweet, light in alcohol and five bucks a bottle, it caught the fancy of wine drinkers nationwide and became the sales phenomenon of the '80s.  Wineries large and small have capitalized on it.  None more so than Sutter Home.  Suddenly, from a modest 30,000-case winery, its sales leaped to a million in 1986.  Estimated sales for this year are 3.2 million cases and the Trincheros have built a multimillion-dollar facility on Zinfandel Lane in Napa Valley that operates through the night bottling the wine that has made Sutter Home the biggest name in white Zin.  ---  Ms. Ensrud is a free-lance wine writer based in New York.  Gillette Co. infringed on a patent for foaming gel shaving creams held by S.C. Johnson & Son Inc., a federal court magistrate ruled.  The suit, filed in federal court here in 1983, asked the court to enjoin Gillette from selling its Foamy Gel, a competitor to Johnson's Edge product.  Damages, if any, will be determined in a later hearing.  A Gillette spokeswoman said the personal care products maker won't have to remove its product from the market, because Johnson's patent expired in 1987.

That was the diagnosis of the surrealist painter Roberto Matta at a recent conference of Latin American writers and artists held in a Kent castle; and there is abundant evidence for his view in "Art in Latin America," the major summer exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London's South Bank Centre (until Aug. 6).  Spanning a period from the 1820s, when the countries of Latin America won their independence from Spain and Portugal, to 1980, the exhibition celebrates a revolutionary spirit singularly lacking in complacent British attitudes to its own heritage.  Indeed it might have been better to call the show "Political Art in Latin America," for here we see impassioned portraits of Simon Bolivar the Liberator alongside poignant primitivist slave painting, followed by gallery upon gallery of ever more strident statements, including the revolutionary graphics of the Mexican engraver Jose Guadalupe Posada, the deeply affecting photographs of the Mexican Revolution by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, and the big angry murals of the Mexican artist-insurgents: the ubiquitous Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and their grim "camarada" David Alfaro Siqueiros.  The more subtle exhibits are overwhelmed by the macho ugliness of the muralist contributions, just as the 98-pound Frida must have been crushed under the weight of her, in every sense, epic husband, Diego.  One way of containing the too-ambitious scope of the exhibition might have been to eliminate the objects not intended as artmasks and religious implements as well as propaganda produced for newspapers and documentary photographs.  Their power to affect us, which is considerable, and indeed considerably greater than the paintings that have (often the same) human struggle as their subject, derives in part from what they reveal about the lives that used them; their power is integral rather than interpretive.  As it is, everything that has been included seems to be valued in direct proportion to the anger it expresses, to the degree that it is in service to politics.  There is more to Latin American art than the muffled cries of disenfranchised people.  The lumping together of countries, periods and styles is intended as a celebration of the extraordinary range of talent and preoccupations south of the border.  But it seems strange that the show's organizers, Dawn Ades and her fellow exhibition committee members, have included the rather anonymous, geometric pieces of the 1950s and '60s (such as Venezuelan Jesus Rafael Soto's "Kinetic Structure of Geometric Elements" and Brazilian Lygia Clark's "Rubber Grub"), which speak more of an international preoccupation (with neat lines and synthetic materials) than with anything particularly Latin American, or indeed anything personal, while excluding much of the more obvious, and more obviously Latin American, contemporary abstract painting and sculpture.  The viewer leaves the show not knowing the difference between a work from Paraguay and one from Peru (it may as well have been from Parador, the mythical Latin American country in Richard Dreyfuss's 1988 film, "Moon Over Parador").  No notion of national identity, of development, of roots emerges with any clarity from this, the largest exhibition of its kind ever assembled in Europe.  Another patronizing, or, let's say, confused, view of Latin America is to be found just outside the gallery.  There earnest looking students are selling Peruvian knitted caps with flaps, brightly colored Bolivian rag dolls and, for the ideologically sound, Nicaraguan coffee (never mind that there are no Nicaraguan artists represented in the show).  Whatever one's particular complaints about the ignorance, which, as it were, informs all this, it is not such a bad thing that Latin America is the flavor of the month in England.  At least the usual, gloomy insularity of the island is being pierced by some rays of southern sunshine, and there is something for everybody (students have their ponchos and now graduates can acquire a stunning gaucho coat from Comme des Garcons or a nice ethnic skirt from Byblos).  Meanwhile, a literary conference at Leeds, that castle in Kent (which, as the brochure promised, was "the perfect place for great minds to meet'), gave a hint of other, possibly more profound, products of Latin American influence.  There the buzz was not about magical realism, or indeed about writing at all.  It was more like an inauguration of the promising, if off-and-on-again, presidential campaign of the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa by his peers, including the Cuban Guillermo Cabrera Infante and, in the role of elder statesman, the Mexican Octavio Paz.  Any English writer, with the possible exception of Salman Rushdie, would have to envy the seriousness with which the writer is regarded in Latin America.  Some of that envy, or at least admiration, and a hope that some of the magic will rub off, could be detected in a number of the English contributions.  One young writer described his about-to-be-published first novel, which is set in Peru and has no English characters.  His name?  N.W.R. Shakespeare.  ---  Ms. Fonseca is the editor of the Times Literary Supplement's NB page in London.  Ross W.

A bipartisan congressional group said U.S. foreign policy in the developing world should be redirected toward working more through multinational organizations and away from the traditional bilateral approach.  A report by the Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus, a 130-member research group, said the U.S. no longer has the resources to deal alone with problems, such as environmental damage, drug trafficking and increasing debt burdens, that are international in scope and threaten America's national security.  The report said that as Cold War tensions fade, the familiar East-West orientation of U.S. foreign policy becomes "increasingly irrelevant to our security interests."  Rep. Matthew McHugh (D., N.Y.), a former chairman of the caucus, said recent improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations call for a new definition of national security.  "Today's security threats are problems like global warming and international debt.  They aren't American or Soviet problems alone, and they can't be solved bilaterally -- they are transnational problems that require transnational solutions."  Rep. McHugh said that despite the report's call for greater support for multinational organizations, the trend has gone the other way.  Since 1980, he said, U.S. contributions to multilateral banks have dropped 25%, adjusted for inflation.  The report argued that it is in America's interest to assist developing nations, because their problems pose security threats to the U.S.  It said developing nations buy one-third of U.S. exports and that 25% of U.S. unemployment, or 1.8 million jobs, results from the inability of poor Third World countries to buy U.S. goods.  The report also recommends that U.S. military aid to developing nations should be used "as leverage not just to encourage elections, but to support the consolidation of democracy."  The report added that both the developing and the developed nations should slash their military spending 50% by the year 2000 "to free up huge resources while maintaining mutual security."

In response to your June 27 editorial "What Doesn't Work": All of the studies that seem to be so much in vogue now overlook the most important thing -- teacher morale.  You cannot put something down and respect it at the same time.  American children have received mixed messages about teachers.  For example: Many movies and TV shows portray teachers as oddballs and nerds ("Mister Peepers"), as being cruel ("The Breakfast Club") or even as being sex fiends ("Pretty Maids All in a Row").  When teachers are portrayed in a "positive" light they are usually saccharine/cutsey or more self-sacrificing than anyone ever wants to be.  Meanwhile, these "oddballs" are told to teach values and morality in addition to the basics, but then get criticized when they do try.  They are given a mandate to teach everything a child should be learning at home, without having the power or authority to do the job right.  To make education work, it probably should be separated from politics.  As it is now, school administrators walk a tightrope between the demands of the community and the realities of how children really act when they are away from home.  It's in an administrator's best interest never to bring bad news to the school board.  Consequently, teachers' pleas for help and/or empowerment fall on deaf ears or get lost in the bureaucracy.  An administrator must give the impression that he can cope with all problems.  Many school boards run their districts like absentee landlords.  They rarely go into the schools for long periods to see what is really happening, mainly because school hours coincide with business hours.  And they don't spend enough time talking in a non-threatening way with teachers about solutions, so decisions rarely are based on reality or "grass-roots" input.  Parents know you don't give children everything they ask for.  Maybe it's time to realize this is true for communities, too.  The result of trying to give everything is that the children get spoiled and the public becomes unreasonable, and both of them lose respect for what they do receive.  Teachers need a massive infusion of respect.  Administrators and school boards cannot repress teachers (sometimes using fear tactics on them) and dismiss their concerns, and then expect them to turn around and turn the community's children into confident, well-functioning members of society with the strength to say "no" to today's destructive temptations.  David W.C. Koven  Milwaukee  ---  As a senior associate with the Education Department from 1982 to 1987, I would like to say that it seems the National Education Association leadership has been more interested in politics than education.  What works in education?  The academic basics.  Teachers bought the worthless truism that not every student learns to read the same way, and of course they don't; but when research shows the vast majority of students make considerable gains in reading scores when they are taught by an intensive phonics method that includes reading comprehension, it is time for our schools to convert from the eclectic approach.  Similarly, the educational experimenters gave us the disastrous "new math," and it is time once again to use a method such as Saxon's, which teaches fundamental math skills and concepts through long-term practice.  D.L. Cuddy  Raleigh, N.C.  ---  Let's open this failed governmental system to free enterprise and allow the public's tax money to go to private as well as public schools.  Let the parent make the choice.  The government's additional obligation then would be to provide regular examinations or other evaluations to ascertain schools' performance with this information made public.  Both public and private schools then would be competing for the tax money, with the parents being the judge.  No doubt the competition would force some major changes in the current government-supported self-serving lethargic educational bureaucracy or it would perish.  Emmett J. Murphy  Woodside, Calif.  ---  Why do upper-middle-class, suburban school districts with mostly white, conservative property owners spend $4,500 to $7,000 a pupil when they would be much better off keeping that money in their pockets?  Their children enter school with few educational disadvantages and are far less likely to drop out of school; therefore, they are cheaper to educate.  These school districts prefer experienced teachers with advanced degrees, pay higher salaries and have low student-teacher ratios.  Why do these taxpayers put up with so much wasteful spending?  Only the poor are ill-served by our education system.  In the 1984 Texas education reforms, we raised both teacher salaries and per-pupil expenditures as well as increasing standards.  Our students' test scores have increased every year, with low-scoring students making the biggest gains.  Gregory Luna  Texas State Representative  Austin, Texas  Paul A.

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that the nation won't know "until well into next year" if the Fed has managed to slow the economy without causing a recession.  "I think we will make it," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee in his semiannual review of monetary policy.  But then he emphasized the uncertainty surrounding any economic forecast.  So far, he said, economic indicators don't suggest an imminent recession.  He suggested that because businesses anticipate a period of slow growth, they are keeping inventories in check and avoiding other "imbalances" that usually precede a recession.  Determined to slow the economy to relieve inflationary pressures, the Fed pushed up interest rates by three full percentage points between March 1988 and March 1989.  In the past two months, amid multiple signs of a slowing economy and few signs of accelerating inflation, the Fed has begun to pull rates down slowly.  The closely watched federal funds rate, the market interest rate over which the Fed has the most control, has fallen about 3/4 of a percentage point from its peak of about 9 3/4% this spring.  Mr. Greenspan yesterday confirmed that the most recent easing occurred last week, but he refused to say whether more is in the works.  Unless new evidence of a deepening economic slowdown emerges, however, the Fed is unlikely to ease its grip on credit again until after its policymaking open-market committee meets Aug. 22.  Mr. Greenspan made it clear that, despite the risk of a recession, the Fed isn't interested in seeing a sharp rebound in economic growth.  He said he anticipates slow growth -- which he didn't define -- for most of 1989 and 1990.  And, repeating statements he made two weeks ago on Capitol Hill, Mr. Greenspan said, "Our policy is not oriented toward avoiding a slowdown in demand. . . .  Rather, what we seek is to avoid an unnecessary and destructive recession."  At the request of one senator, the Fed chairman yesterday defined a "soft landing" of the economy: "Unstable inflationary pressures are contained without simultaneously throwing the economy into a recession."  In addition, Mr. Greenpan said that the recent strength of the dollar has slowed improvements in the U.S. trade deficit but hasn't stopped progress entirely.  He noted that the backlog of orders for U.S. exports continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than last year.  "I would expect, perhaps, not much in the way of movement in our trade balances in the months ahead," Mr. Greenspan said.  But he forecast that "significant" improvement will resume next year.  Mr. Greenspan also said that staff members from the Fed, the Treasury and the president's Council of Economic Advisers are in the early stages of examining ways -- such as tax incentives -- that the government might encourage private savings.  The resulting proposals, if any, aren't likely to emerge until early next year.  In a back room of the Taiwan legislature a few aged members of the Kuomintang ruling party sit napping, their heads resting on a battered wooden table.  Nearby, one of the opposition's liveliest lawmakers, Chu Kao-cheng, leans back in a sagging chair and starts to explain the role of democratic dissent in the Republic of China.  Gone are the days when the KMT could ignore its critics, Mr. Chu says.  "Two-and-a-half years ago, no one challenged the KMT. Then I challenged it.  Now nobody is afraid."  Mr. Chu may not be quite the white knight of Taiwan democracy he claims.  But he is correct that politics on Taiwan is fast becoming more open and competitive.  In late 1986, the KMT-run government under the late President Chiang Ching-kuo allowed the opposition to campaign for political office.  The handful of victors, including Mr. Chu, has since brought some vigorous debate -- along with occasional brawls -- to the previously placid legislature.  The KMT old guard, elected in mainland China in 1947 and accustomed to an atmosphere of genteel despotism, finds the noise and fuss something of a strain.  But for most of the 20 million people on Taiwan, it comes as a welcome change.  "Three years ago, no one talked politics," says a young housekeeper.  "Now people are much more interested."  The signs are that Taiwan has traveled far enough from authoritarianism toward democracy so that there is no turning back.  In July 1987, President Chiang Ching-kuo ended 38 years of martial law.  A ban on starting up newspapers has been repealed, giving rise to a lively opposition press.  Political parties have been legalized.  Even the taboo subject of Taiwan independence from the mainland, though still technically seditious, is openly discussed.  "I was very amazed how the KMT has changed," said Annette Lu, a lawyer who served a five-year jail sentence for sedition in the early 1980s.  The KMT's increasing political tolerance, however, hardly adds up to democracy.  That would require rulers willing to lose power in an election, and it is by no means clear that the KMT's tolerance extends that far.  Elections to the legislature, provincial assembly and local offices in December will provide an important test.  The opposition might best speed Taiwan's democratization by producing a few major contenders with a well-reasoned platform.  KMT incumbents suffer from the party's authoritarian past, but they also run on a record of economic success.  When President Chiang Kai-shek and two million followers fled to Taiwan in 1949, after losing mainland China to the communists, per capita income on both sides of the straits was about equal.  Today Taiwan is the world's 13th-largest trading entity.  Per capita income is more than $6,000; the mainland's is $300.  Political development has been slower.  Well into the 1980s, the government exiled, beat up and imprisoned dissidents, forbade travel, restricted the press and in general made itself an easy target for Amnesty International.  Those days are pretty much over, but the KMT still does not seem to be entirely sold on the ideal of a free and fair democratic system.  In the military, civil service and parts of the economy, state and party are indistinguishable.  The three television channels and 300-odd radio stations are all still government or KMT-run.  Two advocates of independence, Tsai Youchan and Hsu Tsao-teh, were convicted last year of sedition and are now doing time in prison.  Most important, the government is still dominated by KMT old-timers.  In the Legislative Yuan, two-thirds of the members were elected in 1947 on the mainland.  In the National Assembly, which elects the president and amends the Constitution, the disparity is even greater: 786 of 870.  The average age is 82.  "To us, that's ridiculous," says Tsai Shih-yuan, deputy secretary general of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.  "That's not democracy in any sense of the word."  DPP is the major player in the opposition.  It won 22% of the votes in the elections in 1986 and holds 13 seats in the Legislative Yuan and 11 in the National Assembly.  It would like to get 30% of the vote in December's election and increase its legislative representation to 20 seats, the minimum needed to propose bills.  That's unlikely.  KMT-led reforms have disarmed the DPP of its best issue -- democratization -- and internal DPP bickering over whether Taiwan should declare independence has sidetracked the party from more realistic issues.  The animated Chu Kao-cheng, for example, opposes independence.  For this, he may be kicked out of the DPP.  "They think ideology is all," Mr. Chu says of his troubles with the DPP's independence-minded New Tide faction.  "They think Taipei traffic will be improved only if Taiwan declares independence."  For most voters this election, the crucial issues are such drab but immediate matters as housing, development, pollution and education.  On these, it's often hard to distinguish between the DPP and KMT. "Right now, there's not too much difference," says Lu Ya-lit, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.  At least the KMT has a record it can run on; the DPP does not.  Founded largely by former dissidents, many of them once jailed for their views, the DPP has not yet made the leap from outcasts to contenders.  The opening is there.  President Lee Teng-hui, this land's first Taiwan-born president, is enormously popular, yet less than 40% of voters in a recent survey said they were satisfied with Taiwan's judicial system, environment, traffic, finances or taxes.  It's precisely such issues the DPP can't seem to agree on -- or even care about.  KMT policy isn't always clear either.  Asked how the party will clean up the environment -- a big issue in a place where many motorcyclists wear surgical masks against the dirty air -- KMT cultural affairs director James Chu says vaguely, "We are for clean air and clean water."  Complicating matters further in the DPP's search for coherence are the "young turks" of the KMT.  These Western-educated, Taiwan-born technocrats are the prime movers behind political reform.  For the average citizen, who has seen his living standard soar under the KMT but wants faster progress toward democracy, the KMT's young generation may look pretty good.  The DPP has shown signs of political maturity.  It recently struck a deal not to filibuster a group of bills in return for an agreement to recess the Legislative Yuan early and to decrease the legislative quorum -- exactly the way an opposition is supposed to work.  The party even reprimanded a DPP legislator recently for jumping on the podium and screaming -- conduct that not long ago would have drawn a pat on the back.  But unless the DPP can prove that it's able to govern -- first, by governing itselfthe most likely outcome for Taiwan is a one-party democracy of the sort that has enriched the rulers and irritated the voters in Washington, D.C., Mexico and Japan.  For Taiwan's sake, it's time the DPP quit tinkering with ideology and started bidding for power.  ---  Ms. Murphy is features editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal.  AUTOMATED AUDITING shows no convincing benefits so far, the GAO reports.  The plan to enhance audits with computers cost $187 million through fiscal 1988.  It's "plagued by escalating costs, schedule delays, and elusive benefits," the General Accounting Office tells Congress.  The administration even cut the project's 1990 budget request 82% to $19.5 million, the GAO says, approvingly.  The IRS can't show that equipping auditors with 18,000 portable computers -- the only operational step so far -- has led to more audits or tax revenue.  A national system was to be ready this year and cost $1 billion; now it's scheduled for 1995 and $1.8 billion.  The GAO questions the benefits estimate of $16.2 billion over nine years and the IRS's ability to merge the system into its overall processing-modernization program, in view of computer-software and other problems.  Before investing more, the IRS must improve its strategy and benefits analyses, the GAO says.  A spokesman says the IRS is rethinking the system and still feels it can be beneficial and cost-effective.  CHARITY DEDUCTIONS clash with credits for restoring a historic building.  To foster preservation, credits are allowed for rehabilitating certified historic property.  But if a restorer disposes of a building before the end of its useful life, a proportional part of the credit must be recaptured-repaid as tax.  Thus, the limits on aiding such a worthy cause are complex, as IRS Revenue Ruling 89-90 shows.  It concerns the sale or charitable gift to a local historical society of a facade easement -- the right to control the outward appearance of a historic structure.  If, after getting a credit, a taxpayer sells an easement to an exempt society, that is a partial disposition, the IRS says, so part of the credit in proportion to the easement's market value must be recaptured.  The same is true of a donation for which the restorer takes a charitable deduction.  The law makes no exception for donations of easements.  THIS HOME COMPUTER was required by omission, not commission.  An employee's own home computer may not be deducted as a business cost unless its use is for the employer's convenience and required as an employment condition.  Still, that use needn't be required explicitly, as the Tax Court told a Champaign, Ill., couple.  Professor Thomas C. Cadwallader taught psychology; Judy C. Douglas was a public-transportation planner.  Their employers neither provided access to a computer nor required the purchase of one.  Still, the law demands only that a computer be required in order to perform duties properly.  Cadwallader and Douglas needed a computer to manage and process massive quantities of research and work data properly, Judge Clapp found.  Also, their computer spared their employers the cost of providing such equipment and thus was purchased for the employers' convenience.  The judge let the couple deduct the computer.  But the judge denied Cadwallader's home-office deduction because the focal point and the dominant part of his activities were on campus.  CIGARETTE TAXES, the butt of revenue seekers, have been raised in 13 states in 1989.  Increases run from one cent a pack in Oregon to 15 cents in Nevada.  Connecticut's 14-cent rise gives it the highest state excise tax -- 40 cents, the Tobacco Institute says.  Legislators in seven other states still are considering proposed increases.  TAX REAX TO FAX.  Four of the 10 IRS service centers -- those in Ogden, Utah; Fresno, Calif.; Kansas City, Mo., and Cincinnati -- now accept facsimile transmissions from practitioners of documents needed to help resolve audit, collection and other matters for their clients.  GOLDBERG'S PICK for IRS chief counsel is said to be Abraham N.M. Shashy Jr., 39, a partner in the Dallas office of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue.  Goldberg became commissioner July 5.  The post of chief counsel has been vacant since Nov. 1.  SHORE LORE FOR THE CORPS: A Marine captain may not pay tax by giving up 60 days of accumulated leave, says IRS private ruling 8928016.  Income taxes must be paid in legal tender, meaning cash, it says.  SALES-TAX DEMANDS on out-of-state retailers will be tested anew in two cases.  The actions succeed North Dakota's recently settled suit against Spiegel Inc.; the Chicago-based mail-order merchant has decided to collect taxes even in states where it has no facilities or agents.  The new rival suits -- one filed by North Dakota and one sponsored by the Direct Marketing Association -- are aimed again at a 1967 Supreme Court decision that favors retailers.  In a North Dakota court, the state seeks to require collections on its behalf by Quill Corp. of Lincolnshire, Ill., a privately owned concern that sells office equipment by direct mail; the state believes it ultimately can get the 1967 decision reversed.  Conversely, the trade group backs a California suit by Sturbridge Yankee Workshop Inc. of Westbrook, Maine, that is relying on the Supreme Court opinion to defeat California's demands on out-of-state retailers.  The trade group believes its suit can reach the Supreme Court in about three years -- and win reaffirmation.  BRIEFS: A bill to require tax withholding for farm workers is proposed by Rep. Panetta (D., Calif.); he says they fail to report $1.3 billion in annual income. . . .  The House passed a fiscal 1990 budget for the IRS of $5.56 billion, $14.9 million more than the administration sought.  The woman from Lebanon's Hezbollah, or Party of God, was trying to explain her organization's position on the taking of Western captives.  "Of course, we are against taking hostages.  At the same time, if anyone trespasses our rights, we'll go ahead," she said.  "It isn't that we support it, but it is a means of defending ourselves."  The conversation took place in a Tehran hotel room two weeks ago, before the current crisis over the Israeli abduction of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric and pro-Iran leader in Lebanon, and the apparent killing of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.  The group that claimed to have killed Col. Higgins is believed by U.S. intelligence agencies to be a faction of Hezbollah, a pro-Iran Shiite group.  Both Iran's president-elect, Hashemi Rafsanjani, and hardline Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi have said recently that Iran isn't in control of the hostage takers.  But in conversation with the women of Hezbollah visiting Tehran, a rather different picture emerged.  "We are followers of Velayat-e-faqih -- Islamic orders," explained one of the women, an editorial writer for an Islamic magazine.  "Whatever the leader says, we are to follow."  The delegation of about half a dozen Hezbollah members was in Tehran to take part in a conference on the life and works of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  The woman said her particular group didn't hold any captives.  "But Hezbollah isn't just one group -- anyone who follows God and the Koran is Hezbollah," she said.  At the conference, a Hezbollah delegate delivered several passionate speeches about the late Ayatollah Khomeini.  "Now we divide our lives into two parts: before and after his death," she said.  "The people of Lebanon haven't stopped weeping at their loss."  Like the other Hezbollah delegates, she wore the severest of Islamic dress, her black chador, or shawl, pulled tight over a cowelled hood and long tunic.  But in the privacy of her hotel room, she was barely recognizable in a sheer silk shift, her blonde-streaked hair flowing free to her waist.  The editorial writer, meanwhile, lounged on the bed in a pink satin negligee with a deep-plunge neckline.  The conversation began with a 45-minute dissertation on "the oppressions designed by the superpowers" to torment Lebanese Moslems.  "You have to remember that the U.S. ship New Jersey destroyed half of Lebanon, and the cluster bombs of the Israelis were made in the U.S.A.," she said.  She also pointed out that the late Lebanese leader, the Maronite Christian Bashir Gemayel, allegedly was an asset of the Central Intelligence Agency.  "It shows how these three, Israel, the Maronites and America, were hand in hand," she says.  "So it's only natural for the Moslem nation to start a struggle against them."  Nevertheless, the women were anxious about their demonic image in the West.  "Please convey our greetings to the American people," she said.  "We aren't against them, only their government.  When you come to Lebanon, I promise Hezbollah is the group you will like best of all," she said with a grin.  The same week, the husbands of some of the women also were in Tehran, participating in Iranian-sponsored negotiations to end the bloody feud between Hezbollah and the somewhat more moderate Lebanese Shiite organization, Amal.  During Ayatollah Khomeini's lifetime, Iran built up and backed Hezbollah at the expense of Amal, largely because, as an established militia and political party, Amal wouldn't blindly follow Tehran's dictates.  The reconciliation, which was successful, is a possible signal of the newly pragmatic tone of Iranian foreign policy in the post-Khomeini era.  According to one well-informed Iranian analyst, some key Iranian politicians have long seen the hostage impasse as an embarrassment -- a blunder that discredited the Islamic revolution without reaping any major political gain.  But the current crisis is likely to hamper any moderation.

Friedman.  National Westminster Bank PLC, buffeted by a #395 million ($654 million) provision for bad Third World loans, posted sharply lower profit in the first half.  The results add to the tumult of last week's management purge.  The giant British bank is reeling from the aftershock of a highly critical government report about its rights offering for Blue Arrow PLC in 1987.  Though he wasn't specifically cited, NatWest Chairman Lord Boardman has moved forward his planned retirement to Sept. 30 from year's end.  Half a dozen other senior executives, including two NatWest deputy chief executives and another board member, have resigned from NatWest and other British banks following last month's report.  Yesterday, NatWest lost another board member.  British Petroleum Co. Chairman Sir Peter Walters resigned after eight years as a director because of new commitments elsewhere, including a directorship at SmithKline Beecham PLC, according to Lord Boardman.  Sir Peter couldn't be reached yesterday.  Meanwhile, NatWest Deputy Chairman Sir Philip Wilkinson was hospitalized yesterday after an apparent heart attack.  Sir Philip led a NatWest internal investigation into Blue Arrow last year.  NatWest is trying to put the Blue Arrow affair behind it, although British law-enforcement inquiries could lead to criminal charges.  Lord Boardman said the bank has strengthened financial controls and management in its investment-banking and securities unit.  He also said the affair won't have a material financial impact on NatWest.  The first-half figures won't help much.  NatWest's pretax profit was halved to #352 million from #702 million in the year-earlier half, after the Third World debt provision and an additional #190 million provision largely for potentially nonperforming British loans.  Net income tumbled 59% to #184 million from #446 million after a #5 million extraordinary charge for closure of its U.S. government-securities dealership.  There wasn't any charge a year earlier.  Describing the first-half results as a "solid performance," Lord Boardman said pretax profits before debt provisions rose 13% to a record #937 million, as growth in NatWest's corporate, international and investment-banking business offset a downturn in its increasingly competitive British market.  The debt provision raises NatWest's reserves for problem-country debt to #1.35 billion ($2.23 billion), or 48% of its #2.8 billion outstanding in those countries.  The NatWest figures matched analysts' expectations, and NatWest shares rose three pence to 330 pence in late trading yesterday on London's stock exchange.  Robert Law, a London analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said the most significant feature was the bank's domestic-banking slowdown, where pretax profits slid 11% to #456 million from #515 million -- largely the result of high British interest rates.  The rates are cooling mortgage demand and prompted an increase in provisions for personal-loan defaults.  Lord Boardman said the bank remains committed to building its investment-banking operations, despite the departure of some corporate clients over the Blue Arrow affair and continuing losses in domestic securities markets.  Its investment-banking operations rebounded to a #38 million pretax profit from a #1 million loss in the year-earlier period, attributed to venture-capital asset sales.  The underlying British securities business had a #12 million loss in the first half, roughly equal to a year earlier.  The government's report on NatWest's handling of the Blue Arrow offering has highlighted gaps in London's financial-regulatory system, and could result in tighter rules.  It criticized some executives for misconduct and said NatWest failed to make timely disclosure of a 9.5% Blue Arrow stake, accumulated when its #837 million rights issue for the big employment-services company flopped.  The regulatory system bogs down in a bewildering array of overlapping agencies and desultory investigation and enforcement.  In the Blue Arrow case, Bank of England officials knew about NatWest's holding soon after the disappointing underwriting.  But they didn't investigate why NatWest's investment-banking unit failed to publicly disclose the stake because that is the exclusive province of another regulator, Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.  That agency ultimately launched its own probe.  Some British officials now say the Blue Arrow affair could lead to tightened regulation by a single agency -- possibly the central bank -- instead of the five overlapping agencies that currently examine different aspects of the British securities industry.  Bridgestone Corp. said it combined into a single company its scattered North American subsidiaries, including Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.  The Japanese tire maker is consolidating management of the new company, called Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., in Akron, Ohio.  Bridgestone and Firestone had been operating three headquarters in Akron, Chicago and Nashville, Tenn.  Both the Chicago and Nashville offices will be closed.  A fourth Bridgestone operation in Canada also will report to Akron.  John J. Nevin, 62 years old, was named chairman of the new company until year-end, when he plans to retire.  As Firestone chief executive, Mr. Nevin restructured the company, moved its headquarters to Chicago from Akron and orchestrated its sale last year for $2.6 billion.  Mr. Nevin, who has long expressed a desire to become a university professor, declined to be interviewed for this article.  George W. Aucott, 54, who had been Firestone's president and chief operating officer and remained in Akron, was named chief executive officer and president of Bridgestone/Firestone.  He is slated to become chairman of the new company when Mr. Nevin retires, Bridgestone said.  Mr. Aucott, a 34-year veteran of Firestone, was traveling and wasn't available to comment, a Firestone spokesman said.  About 250 employees, or half the staff at Nashville and Chicago, are expected to accept transfers to Akron, a Bridgestone spokesman said.  In addition, about 300 headquarters jobs in Akron are expected to be created, the spokesman added.  Consolidation had been expected since Bridgestone acquired Firestone.  Among other things, the companies had been slow in integrating the marketing of both Firestone and Bridgestone brand tires.  For instance, Bridgestone tires only recently were added to Firestone's line at Firestone's chain of MasterCare automotive repair stores.  "This consolidation probably was a necessary step to effectively operate in the North American market because the autonomy between the three operations was causing confusion on the part of customers as well as individual managers," said Harry W. Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co., Cleveland.  Mr. Millis said the consolidation should help Bridgestone in its stated goal of surpassing Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the industry leader, in the next four years.  Goodyear, of Akron, currently is struggling to retain its position over Groupe Michelin of France.  Another emerging global player is Continental AG of West Germany, which purchased Akron-based General Tire & Rubber Co.  Mr. Aucott joined Firestone as a time study engineer in 1956.  He was named president of Firestone Canada Inc. in 1978, and was appointed vice president of manufacturing for the company's North American tire group two years later.  In 1982, he was named president of the world tire group and in 1986 he was elected an executive vice president and a director.  Mr. Aucott is assuming control of a company that has the backing of a cash-rich Japanese parent.  That should help him as the economy cools and new car sales dwindle.  But he also will be facing considerable challenges.  One will be to improve Bridgestone's image in the U.S. Bridgestone's name is still relatively unknown in Detroit although it has a strong reputation in Japan and Europe as a maker of sporty high-performance tires and truck tires.  In addition, Mr. Aucott may have to try to rebuild any damage to Firestone's name as a result of being dropped as a supplier to General Motors Corp.  Soon after the Bridgestone acquisition of Firestone was announced, GM said that Firestone would be phased out as a tire supplier.  Firestone supplied 20% of GM's North American passenger cars and light trucks.  Despite a 9% sales climb, Eastman Kodak Co. said net income plunged 85% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting an expected restructuring charge of $227 million.  The photographic, chemicals and pharmaceutical concern also estimated its second-half profits will be "at the same level" as the year-ago net income of $747 million, or $2.31 a share.  Kodak said it earned $60 million, or 18 cents a share, in the latest period, down from $390 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier.  Sales rose to $4.50 billion from $4.13 billion.  Based on the second-half projection, year-end operating earnings should approach $3.80 a share, compared with $4.31 a share in 1988.  Higher costs, greater interest expense and unfavorable currency translations depressed second-period earnings, although the company posted higher volumes in its core businessess, such as photographic film and paper.  While he called volume gains "gratifying," Colby H. Chandler, chairman and chief executive of the Rochester, N.Y., company, said earnings were disappointing and promised "strong steps" to address the situation.  Kodak, which last week disclosed the anticipated restructuring charge, indicated it would intensify its plan to cut costs and improve results.  Yesterday, the company reiterated that goal before New York analysts but "strongly suggested" that the restructuring would not entail sale of a major business or similar actions, analysts said following the meeting.  Wall Street professionals, abuzz lately with speculation that a major streamlining was in the works, are now wondering just how much is being considered in additional write-offs.  "It's just a question of how many notches there are on the belt," said Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  Even discounting the restructuring charge, which equaled about 70 cents a share, earnings fell far short of analysts' estimates that the company would earn $1.05 to $1.10 a share before the charge.  Excluding the one-time item, net income was 88 cents a share.  "The second-quarter results were considerably less than what we expected," said B. Alex Henderson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., who lowered his year-end operating earnings estimate to $3.70 a share from $4.10.  Kodak stock fell $1.25 a share to $47 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.  Although the company reported strong sales gains, operating profit declined in most businesses, particularly in the information systems segment, which makes copiers and printers.  It posted a sales increase of 13% to $989 million from a year-earlier $878 million, but operating earnings slid 93% to $6 million from $92 million.  Sales gains in Kodak's imaging business were also offset by poor operating results.  Operating earnings dropped 6% to $341 million from a year-earlier $363 million despite a sales jump of 9% to $1.77 billion.  One analyst attributed the disappointing margins to the company's business strategy of meeting strong competitive pressures.  "Kodak is trying to retain its market share at the cost of earnings," said Michael Ellmann, a Wertheim Schroder analyst, noting that the company has kept film and paper prices down despite increased costs.  In the first half, Kodak posted net income of $260 million, or 80 cents a share, down 60% from $650 million, or $2 a share, a year ago.  Sales jumped 13% to $8.4 billion from $7.46 billion.  Bobby Kahn, campaign manager for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes, interviewed for the political news service Hotline (July 6):  We don't think the state ought to be in the business of building up expectations and misleading people -- and that's the only way you make a lottery work in terms of bringing in revenue.  Some of the things these states are getting by with on their advertising wouldn't pass muster with the Better Business Bureau.  Studies have shown that where there is neutral advertising -- informative and not encouraging -- the lottery doesn't bring in any revenue.  Cooper Industries Inc., adding to its string of recent purchases, said it agreed to acquire Cameron Iron Works Inc. in exchange for stock.  The transaction, with an indicated value of about $700 million, provides an out for certain major Cameron holders who wanted to dispose of their 47.53% stake in the company.  Earlier this year, Cameron hired investment advisers to help it achieve that goal.  The merger also continues an acquisitive spurt by Cooper, which just last week completed its $800 million bid for Champion Spark Plug Co.  Under terms of the definitive agreement, approved by the boards of both companies, each Cameron shareholder will receive one share of Cooper convertible exchangeable preferred stock for every five Cameron shares owned.  The Cooper preferred stock, which will have an annual dividend of $8 a share, will be convertible into 2.75 shares of Cooper common.  Cameron has about 30.6 million common shares outstanding, as well as 1.5 million preferred shares, which would be exchanged for convertible subordinated debentures under the agreement.  After five years, Cooper can redeem its preferred stock or exchange it for Cooper convertible subordinated debentures.  The deal had been anticipated in recent weeks and caught few on Wall Street by surprise.  Cooper closed at $34.125 yesterday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, up 50 cents.  Cameron, also in Big Board trading, fell $1.375 to $22.125.  It was a decision by trustees for the George Anderson Robinson and the Jaime Abercrombie Robinson trusts to pull out of Cameron "that really was what precipitated this" merger, said a Cameron spokesman.  Cameron, a 69-year-old maker of products for the energy industry and other fields, had revenue for the year ended June 30 of $610 million.  Cooper, a manufacturing concern, had 1988 revenue of $4.3 billion.  Both Cooper and Cameron are based in Houston.  Spending on new construction declined 0.8% in June, with the drop centered in public works and housing, the Commerce Department said.  The decline, to an annual rate of $414.7 billion, followed a revised increase of 0.6% in May -- originally reported as a 1.3% rise.  Construction spending has been on a roller-coaster ride for the past few months.  It fell 0.8% in April, rose 0.2% in March and fell 1.5% in February.  June spending was 1.5% above the year-earlier rate of $408.7 billion.  After taking inflation into account, June spending was 1% below the May rate and 3.1% below June 1988.  All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.  Private spending for new housing units, a figure tied closely to mortgage rates, dropped 1.2% in June to a $136.6 billion annual rate.  Mortgage rates have fallen sharply in the past few months, but economists say it will take some time for construction spending to reflect the decline.  Total private spending on residential building fell 1.1% from May.  Private nonresidential construction rose 2.8% to an annual rate of $100.3 billion.  Public construction fell 4.8% in June, after two months of considerable increase.  Spending for June was estimated at an annual rate of $80.6 billion, down from revised May expenditures of $84.7 billion.  Analysts attributed the decrease in public construction spending to strained budgets at the federal and state level.  Here are the Commerce Department's figures for construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rates.  @ June May June  @ 1989 1989 1988  @ Total new construction ..... 414.7 418.2 408.7  @ Residential ............... 197.9 200.2 196.2  @ Nonresidential ............ 100.3 97.6 99.3  @ Public .................... 80.6 84.7 80.8  The typical reader picks up a book of previously published essays with a strong sense of foreboding and anticipated boredom.  The stereotype of such volumes is a tedious grab bag lacking in continuity and freshness.  Daniel Pipes's "The Long Shadow: Culture and Politics in the Middle East" (Transaction Publishers, 303 pages, $32.95) breaks the rules.  This informative volume establishes the essayist as an authoritative commentator on the Middle East.  Unlike all too many social scientists these days, fond of converting regional politics into global theories, Mr. Pipes argues that the Middle East's complexities and contradictions are understandable only through studying the local languages, cultures and history.  He himself devotes an interesting section to the dramatic impact the West has had on local culture and religion, finance and commerce and, above all, the promotion of secularism in the Islamic world.  "America is ubiquitous," he writes.  But anyone expecting a more moderate tone to emanate, especially from Iran, should note that its new leader recently returned from a Moscow love fest with Mikhail Gorbachev, a visit that would hardly surprise Mr. Pipes, who writes: "However dangerous the Soviet Union, the United States always looks worse."  Mr. Pipes reminds us that Middle East politics are all too often viewed in exclusively Arab-Israeli terms.  For this, he blames the media and its "obsession with Israel," which distorts and confuses our understanding of the region as a whole.  Hostages, Palestinians and domestic Israeli developments all receive inordinate coverage because they involve the U.S. or Israel or both.  Such stories as the Iran-Iraq war and internal conditions within Arab states get little attention until and unless they become tied to the U.S. or Israeli interests.  "The Syrian government of Hafiz al-Assad could devastate one of its own cities, Hama, without a photograph getting out," he writes.  Except for a small essay on a trip to Kuwait, all of these articles were completed prior to 1988.  The reader, therefore, has a benefit of hindsight.  The U.S. intervened in the Gulf to guarantee neutral shipping; the Iran-Iraq War ended; the Arabs of the West Bank rose up in the "intifada"; the Gorbachev policy has been extended uncertainly to the region.  Yet, in many articles Mr. Pipes is prescient.  Long before the Moslems of Soviet Central Asia were making headlines, Mr. Pipes was predicting their emergence from a quasi-colonial status.  "Eventually, (though when is a matter of speculation), Uzbeks, Tajiks, and the others will become stubbornly nationalistic, and the Soviet regime will face unprecedented internal troubles."  While he did not anticipate Iraq's successful offensive at the end of the war with Iran, his analysis of the geopolitical reasons for the carnage is the best brief review of the history of the tensions between these two countries this reader has seen.  Turning to the Arab-Israeli conflict, Mr. Pipes describes with equal clarity the congeries of pain, fear and frustration.  In a short, poignant article, "Two Bus Lines to Bethlehem," he ponders how Jews and Arabs will coexist in a country in which even public transport is segregated.  "That each people sticks to its own bus line explains why terrorists so often choose to attack buses," he writes.  Mr. Pipes also understands the role that the inter-Arab competition has always played in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  "Multiple actors prohibit a lasting peace with Israel.  Resolution waits for the Arab positions to be whittled down."  He sees the PLO as a creature spawned by inter-Arab turmoil: "The PLO flourished by becoming an organization answerable to rulers rather than refugees."  West Bankers, he writes, probably will emerge as the focal point for the Palestinian cause, and the ongoing intifada confirms that they have indeed taken steps to assume responsibility for their own future.  Mr. Pipes believes the U.S. has real enemies in the Middle East: terrorists, Syrians, Iranians, Russians, Islamic fundamentalists.  He advocates a steely strong response and rejects any Carteresque genuflection to "forces beyond our control."  To this reader the weakness of the volume lies in the author's sometimes shortsighted view of the Soviet Union.  The roots of recent transformations in the Palestinian movement may be found in Mr. Pipes's essays, but there is no hint whatsoever of the cooling relationship between Moscow and Damascus, or the Kremlin's attempt to press the PLO into a more pliant stance, never mind the recently commenced dialogue with Israel.  Moscow may have changed less than its apologists would have us believe, but it has changed, and Mr. Pipes will have to take account of these moves in the future.  But these concerns are relatively minor.  "The Long Shadow" is a provocative and insightful tour through the pitfalls of Mideast politics, history and culture.  ---  Mr. Spiegel is a professor of political science at UCLA specializing in American foreign policy toward the Middle East.  Prospects for continued war between the executive and legislative branches in Washington lead one to think a START (Staff Trimming As a Reasonable Target) agreement might help to reduce tension.  After all, the arms in this conflict are the ones that operate the photocopy machines and reach for the phones in the course of taking new shots at the opposition in our divided government.  As it turns out, however, a war-head count shows the buildup to have undergone a virtual freeze even as the skirmishes grew hotter during the Reagan years.  And, on paper, the legislative side would appear to be the peacemaker.  Yet beware of congressional camouflage.  Although the total payroll for that branch actually has shrunk since 1980, and at 37,546 (as of March) was smaller than in 1975, the decline is owed mainly to economies at the Government Printing Office and the Library of Congress, noncombatants in the Polled War.  The minions working directly for members are nearly as numerous as ever at more than 19,300, a force level about a thousand greater than in 1986.  This still represents arms control compared with the explosive growth on Capitol Hill during the Nixon presidency. (Staffing grew by almost 50% between 1970 and 1975.)  Meanwhile, the Reagan era effectively tightened the ammo belts of many an executive warrior.  Consider these dropoffs between 1980 and 1989: Agriculture, 129,139111,683; Education, 7,364-4,601; Energy, 21,557-17,042; Health and Human Services, 155,662-122,315; Labor, 23,400-18,410 (it's growing again, however); Transportation, 72,361-64,250 (same thing there).  Some cabinet-level curiosities: The Carter administration initiated some disarmament, notably at Interior (which grew under James Watt) and State (which also grew back under the Republicans).  The Defense Department's civilian staff, though it has grown by more than 10% since 1980 in order to respond to all that congressional micromanagement, is barely above what it was in 1975.  Parts of the government did add throw weight during the Reagan years.  The Justice Department swelled to 78,659 from 56,327, and this wasn't just more prosecutors, wardens and border patrols -- the administrative wing more than kept pace.  And a recent upsurge at Treasury puts its count at 172,947, vs. 124,663 in 1980.  Lots of new IRS petty officers, it turns out.  In raw recruits, the biggest enlistment boom of the 1980s was at the hapless Postal Service.  Higher stamp prices are necessary because 845,000 are billeted there now, vs. 660,000 when a letter cost 18 cents.  Elsewhere in the independent agencies, however, admirable downsizing was widely evident, with some cutting their payloads in half.  Top prize has to go to the General Services Administration, which manages federal property: Its 37,654 workers in 1980 saw the ranks thinned by nearly 18,000 by 1989.  Just as with the congresspeople, recent deployments have been under way in executive agencies: The Environmental Protection Agency, after a celebrated detente under Anne Burford, is now bigger than it was when Mr. Reagan was having his bouts with trees in California.  The space agency is lifting off again, as is the Office of Personnel Management (it's up 14% over '86, with only 3% more total personnel to manage).  Veterans Affairs last year was awarded a new stripe, you recall, and sure enough its command continues to grow.  Finally, of all things, the Panama Canal Commission has added more than 500 to its rolls since 1986.  And we're not even talking to Noriega]  The larger picture, nevertheless, remains encouraging for the outgunned taxpayer.  With troop strengths in the War of Washington down in the '80s in relation to the peaceable population, civilians might learn to live with all the bombblasts.  Of course, the third branch of government might always try to work out an armistice.  Its interventions to date haven't sheathed any swords, but the judicial juggernaut has marched on through all manner of political terrain, more than tripling its own legions since 1970.  ---  Ferguson is features editor of the Journal's editorial page.  A closely watched barometer of economic conditions reached its lowest level in more than six years in July as the nation's purchasing agents reported slippage in their measures of production, new orders and inventories.  The National Association of Purchasing Management said its overall index fell for the third month in a row, registering 46% in July, down significantly from 48.8% in June and the lowest level since a 46% reading in January 1983, when the current economic expansion was in its early stages.  A level below 50% indicates U.S. manufacturing is generally declining.  "Fortunately, inflation also continues to decline significantly and exports remain relatively strong," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's survey committee.  Mr. Bretz, director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., said the economy "will continue to go lower until the Federal Reserve Board takes some real stimulative actions.  Then, of course, there's always a lag after that."  With manufacturing accounting for 22% or 23% of gross national product, he said, a dip of the purchasers' index to 44% would indicate "negative real GNP {growth}.  If we had three to six consecutive months below 44%, you'd say yes, we are in a recession."  Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Co., said that "during the past 35 years there has been only one occasion -- in 1967 -- when the purchasing managers' index fell this low {46%} without the economy either already being in a recession or about to enter one."  Each of the survey's indicators gauges the difference between the number of companies reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening.  The report indicated that exports still are providing some push to the economy.  The percentage of companies surveyed that do exporting rose to 72.9% from 71% in June, the fourth consecutive monthly increase.  Of exporters, 22% reported better export orders, up from 18% in June, while 9% reported worse export orders, the same level as June.  Still, export growth isn't as strong as a year ago, "and I don't know how long that's going to continue, with the strong U.S. dollar," Mr. Bretz said.  Overall, he said the economy is "pretty much playing out the same way of other past slowings."  He said purchasers are "very pleased that price increases, which were getting to be a real concern to them, have stopped increasing to the degree they were."  Of course, "there's no question that corporate profits will feel {the impact of softening prices} sooner or later.  We're probably going to see a little bit of a squeeze here."  The production index declined for the first time in three years, reaching its lowest level since July 1985.  The survey said only 17% of the 250 companies surveyed reported higher production in July, while 26% reported less production, up sharply from 15% in June.  The index of new orders fell in July for the second consecutive month, after rising for four years; only 17% reported better new orders, while 28% reported new orders were worse.  The index was at its lowest level since November 1982.  The employment index declined in July for the sixth consecutive month, with 18% reporting lower employment, up from 15% in June; the index was at its lowest level since November 1986.  Vendor deliveries, which tend to speed up when the economy is slowing, were faster in July for the third consecutive month, and only eight commodities were reported in short supply, down from 10 a month ago.  Shortages included castings, bleached paperboard, acrylic acid, caustic soda and soda ash, sodium chlorate, titanium dioxide, polyester, and bearings.  The inventory index declined in July for the seventh consecutive month, with 27% reporting lower inventories and only 13% higher inventories.  The price index declined in July for the second month after 34 months of increases.  Although ten commodities reported higher prices, 21 had lower prices.  "Even the economic bellwether, corrugated shipping containers, was reported down in price after many years of increasing prices," the report said.  With demand slackening, companies tended to shorten lead times for capital expenditures; companies that reported buying ahead six months or longer fell to 52% in July from 53% in June and 57% in January, and the lowest level since June 1988, when the measure was 49%.  Lead times for production materials remained virtually unchanged, with 83% buying ahead 60 days or less and only 3% buying such materials six months ahead or longer.  Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti division, eager to sign up buyers even before its vehicles hit U.S. showrooms, priced its two luxury models at $38,000 and $23,500, and said dealers will now start taking orders.  The two models are priced just slightly above the soon-to-premiere cars from Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus division, but well below similarly equipped cars from European auto makers.  The cars hit the showrooms Nov. 8.  Infiniti said it is breaking with traditional car pricing strategy by offering almost no optional equipment.  The top-of-the-line Q45 sedan will have a base price of $38,000 that includes a 278 horsepower, 32-valve V-8 engine, standard leather seats and a standard driver's-side air bag.  Infiniti will offer only a single, $2,500 option package for the Q45, featuring four-wheel steering and special wheels.  The Infiniti M30 coupe -- available in both convertible and hardtop -- is powered by a three-liter V-6 engine and will list for $23,500, with no options offered, Infiniti said.  "We said, build a car the way customers want it and cut out a lot of the haggling over options," said William R. Bruce, Infiniti's vice president and general manager.  At these prices, Infiniti's cars will look like bargains next to comparable European cars.  A Mercedes 420 SEL sedan with a smaller V-8 engine than the Q45 has a list price of more than $60,000, while a Jaguar XJ6 Vanden Plas starts at $48,000.  The BMW 3-series cars that would compete with the M30 start at $24,650 and range up to more than $30,000.  Further, Mr. Bruce said Infiniti will offer "the most competitive leasing programs" in the luxury market.  He didn't elaborate, except to say that Infiniti will guarantee that Infiniti's residual values -- the value of a car at the end of the lease term -- will "equal or exceed" those of competitive luxury makes.  Generally, the greater the residual value, the lower the monthly payments.  Still, Infiniti will be hard pressed in the $20,000 to $40,000 luxury car segment.  European auto makers have a history of prestige and snob appeal that Infiniti lacks, and they're already offering aggressive discount-leasing programs and rebates.  Honda Motor Co.'s three-year-old Acura division is already well established.  And Toyota Motor's new Lexus luxury division will start delivering its new LS 400 sedan and ES 250 to dealers next month.  In May, Lexus said its top-of-the-line LS 400 sedan will start at $35,000, and sell with options for an average of $37,500.  The Lexus ES 250 will start at $21,050.  Lexus will let U.S. auto writers test-drive its cars this week, and dealers already have started signing up customers.  Now, Infiniti dealers "have been calling us saying we've got to be able to take orders," said Mr. Bruce.  Infiniti also plans to start cranking up its media campaign later this month.  Infiniti will be the official car of the U.S. Open tennis tournament and will launch its first major wave of television advertising on CBS broadcasts of the event, said Infiniti's director of marketing, Peter Bossis.  Until now, Infiniti has stuck to an esoteric print campaign that tried to position the name as the epitome of "Japanese luxury."  The ads featured pictures of shining waves and pussy willow buds, not the cars.  But yesterday, Mr. Bossis said, "We will disseminate a lot more product information" as the advertising evolves.
